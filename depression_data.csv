The primary outcome measurements concern was decline in consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and decline in Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).METHODS: Eighty patients were randomized, either to the psychoeducative programme (consisting of eight sessions, each of 2?hours duration) and 2-year outpatient follow-up (42 cases), or only to 2-year outpatient follow-up (38 controls). The patients were monitored during 2 years after randomization. Data were collected from interviews including BDI, drug treatment and social measurements, and register data concerning use of psychiatric services.RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, a significant reduction in the consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and in BDI was found; however, it was uniform for case and control patients. Drop-out/non-compliance was significantly more frequent among patients randomized to the control group. Furthermore, during follow-up the case group got a significant stronger attachment to the Labour market than the control group.CONCLUSIONS: The primary hypothesis could not be confirmed. Secondary outcome measurements concerning drop-out/non-compliance and attachment to the Labour market were significantly in favour of cases.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of psychoeducation is well documented in the treatment of relapse prevention of schizophrenia, and recently also in bipolar disorder; however, for recurrent depression only few controlled studies focusing on the efficacy of psychoeducation have been conducted.";"The efficacy of psychoeducation on recurrent depression: a randomized trial with a 2-year follow-up";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/387/CN-01368387/frame.html and http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08039488.2016.1266385?needAccess=true";"Nordic journal of psychiatry";"Aagaard, 2017";"Aagaard_2017_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

Raters were blind to patients' assignments. Two hundred seventy-one individuals were screened and 171 were randomized to 12 weekly sessions of either CM or CM-PST. Participants were at least 60 years old with major depression measured with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), had at least one disability, were eligible for home-based meals services, and had income no more than 30% of their counties' median.RESULTS: CM and CM-PST led to similar declines in HAM-D over 12 weeks (t = 0.37, df = 547, p = 0.71); CM was noninferior to CM-PST. The entire study group (CM plus CM-PST) had a 9.6-point decline in HAM-D (t = 18.7, df = 547, p <0.0001). The response (42.5% versus 33.3%) and remission (37.9% versus 31.0%) rates were similar (?(2) = 1.5, df = 1, p = 0.22 and ?(2) = 0.9, df = 1, p = 0.34, respectively). Development of problem-solving skills did not mediate treatment outcomes. There was no significant increase in depression between the end of interventions and 12 weeks later (0.7 HAM-D point increase) (t = 1.36, df = 719, p = 0.17).CONCLUSION: Organizations offering CM are available across the nation. With training in CM, their social workers can serve the many depressed, disabled, low-income patients, most of whom have poor response to antidepressants even when combined with psychotherapy.";"Clinical Case Management versus Case Management with Problem-Solving Therapy in Low-Income, Disabled Elders with Major Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/925/CN-01140925/frame.html and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1064748115000883/1-s2.0-S1064748115000883-main.pdf?_tid=658ebf04-d99f-11e6-a25b-00000aacb361&acdnat=1484319110_dc27db34e3254ceaec0b841fb77e0310";"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry";"Alexopoulos, 2016";"Alexopoulos_2016_pst_otherctr_NA_NA_response(50%)_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

A clinical trial of in-home CBT for depressed mothers in home visitation. Behavior Therapy. 2013;44(3):359-72.";101016;"Despite negative outcomes for depressed mothers and their children, no treatment specifically designed to address maternal depression in the context of home visitation has emerged. In-Home Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (IH-CBT) is an adapted treatment that is delivered in the home, focuses on the needs of new mothers, and leverages ongoing home visiting to optimize engagement and outcomes. This study examined the efficacy of IH-CBT using a randomized clinical trial. Subjects were 93 new mothers in a home visiting program. Mothers with major depressive disorder identified at 3months postpartum were randomized into IH-CBT and ongoing home visitation (n=47) or standard home visitation (SHV; n=46) in which they received home visitation alone and could obtain treatment in the community. Depression was measured at pre- and posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up using interviews, clinician ratings, and self-report.

Participants in PST and RT were provided with 12 weekly sessions of group treatment. Dependent measures, taken at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up, included self-report and observer-based assessments of depressive symptomatology. At posttreatment, both the PST and the RT conditions produced significant reductions in depressive symptoms, compared with the WLC group, and PST participants experienced significantly less depression than RT subjects. Moreover, a significantly greater proportion of participants in PST versus RT demonstrated sufficient positive change to warrant classification of their depression as improved or in remission at the posttreatment and follow-up evaluations.";"Comparative effectiveness of social problem-solving therapy and reminiscence therapy as treatments for depression in older adults";"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ccp/61/6/1003/";"J Consult Clin Psychol";"Arean, 1993";"Arean_1993_lrt_wl_lrt(rt)_wl_msd_gds_self-report_0_post"

All interventions were delivered in a group setting, each session lasting 2 hours. Outcome was assessed post-treatment, after 6 months, and after 12 months. Assessment included self- and clinician ratings. Results: Both active interventions (CBT, UGT) were very well received by participating women (only 1 woman dropped out). They showed statistically and clinically significant improvement of depression and menopausal symptoms. Both treatments were superior to the control condition. These positive effects remained stable over 1 year of follow-up. CBT (ES d = 2.9) proved to be more successful than UGT (ES d = 1.9) in reducing depression and menopausal symptoms as well as in improving marital adjustment (ES d = .41). Conclusions: Both active group treatments proved to be beneficial on all measures and over long-term follow-up. The outcome with CBT in these patients was clearly superior to that of UGT. CBT should be used in the psychological treatment of depressed menopausal women.";"Cognitive behavior therapy for depression in menopausal women.

METHOD: This National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored randomized controlled trial was conducted (from November 2001 through June 2007) at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. The sample included 156 patients diagnosed with MDD (DSM-IV) and having a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD(17)) score >/= 14 for at least 2 consecutive weeks. This was an underserved sample in which 41% were male, 52% were self-designated minorities, and 76% had an annual income under $30,000. Treatment lasted 16 weeks. Medication patients not responsive by week 8 (maximum dose 200 mg/d of sertraline) were switched to venlafaxine (maximum dose 375 mg/d). Nonresponsive placebo patients at week 8 were switched to a different placebo. RESULTS: Patients' depression improved over the 16 weeks (P < .0001), with no between-group differences (P = .95), even among severely (HRSD(17) score >/= 20) depressed patients (P = .45). Response rates did not differ between groups (P = .73). Gender and minority status moderated outcome (P = .014), with psychotherapy more efficacious for minority men than MED (P = .027, Cohen d = 1.02) and PBO (P = .019, d = 1.09). PBO was more efficacious for white men than MED (P = .03, d = 0.62) and SET (P = .003, d = 1.07). For white women, MED (P = .005, d = 0.77) and SET (P = .033, d = 0.71) were more efficacious than placebo. No differences among treatments were found for minority women. CONCLUSIONS: This trial of urban MDD patients failed to confirm that either active treatment was better than placebo. Minority status and gender had significant and differential effects on outcome that warrant replication in future studies.

STUDY DESIGN This was an 11-week randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted in primary care practices in 2 communities (Lebanon, NH, and Seattle, Wash). Paroxetine (n=80) or placebo (n=81) therapy was started at 10 mg per day and increased to a maximum 40 mg per day, or PST-PC was provided (n=80). There were 6 scheduled visits for all treatment conditions. POPULATION We included a total of 241 primary care patients with minor depression (n=114) or dysthymia (n=127). Of these, 191 patients (79.3%) completed all treatment visits. OUTCOMES We measured depressive symptoms using the 20-item Hopkins Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20). Remission was scored on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) as less than or equal to 6 at 11 weeks. We measured functional status with the physical health component (PHC) and mental health component (MHC) of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form. RESULTS All treatment conditions showed a significant decline in depressive symptoms over the 11-week period. There were no significant differences between the interventions or by diagnosis. For dysthymia the remission rate for paroxetine (80%) and PST-PC (57%) was significantly higher than for placebo (44%, P=.008). The remission rate was high for minor depression (64%) and similar for each treatment group. For the MHC there were significant outcome differences related to baseline level for paroxetine compared with placebo. For the PHC there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS For dysthymia, paroxetine and PST-PC improved remission compared with placebo plus nonspecific clinical management. Results varied for the other outcomes measured. For minor depression, the 3 interventions were equally effective; general clinical management (watchful waiting) is an appropriate treatment option.";"Treatment of dysthymia and minor depression in primary care: A ramdomized trial in patients aged 18 to 59 years";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L32440814 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=00943509&id=doi:&atitle=Treatment+of+dysthymia+and+minor+depression+in+primary+care%3A+A+ramdomized+trial+in+patients+aged+18+to+59+years&stitle=J.+Fam.+Pract.&title=Journal+of+Family+Practice&volume=50&issue=5&spage=405&epage=412&aulast=Barrett&aufirst=James+E.&auinit=J.E.&aufull=Barrett+J.E.&coden=JFAPD&isbn=&pages=405-412&date=2001&auinit1=J&auinitm=E.";"Journal of Family Practice";"Barrett, 2001";"Barrett_2001_pst_otherctr_NA_NA_remission(cut-off-dysthymia)_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

Efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) with depressed breast cancer patients: Results of a randomized controlled multicenter trial. Annals of Oncology. 2014;25(2):378-84.";101093;"Background: There is a lack of trials of psychodynamic treatments of depression in breast cancer patients. The purpose of this trial was to determine the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients diagnosed with depression, one of the most frequent mental comorbidities of breast cancer. Patients and methods: In a multicenter prospective trial, 157 breast cancer patients with comorbid depression were randomized to either individual STPP (intervention group, N = 78) or 'treatment as usual' (control group, TAU, N = 79). As our primary outcome measure, we hypothesized a higher rate of remission defined as no diagnosis of depression (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) and reduction in depression score by at least 2 points (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D) in STPP versus TAU at treatment termination. Secondary outcomes mainly refer to quality of life (QoL). Results: In the intention to treat (ITT) analysis, 44% of the STPP group achieved highly significantly more remission than TAU (23%). STPP treatment (OR = 7.64; P < 0.001) was the strongest predictor for remission post-treatment; time was also significant (OR = 0.96; P < 0.05). A high effect favoring STPP (d = 0.82) was observed for the HADS-D score posttreatment (secondary outcome). Regarding further secondary outcomes (QoL), analyses of covariance yielded main effects for group (favoring STPP with an effect size of at least d = 0.5) for global QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, pain, treatment side-effects, breast symptoms and upset by hair loss. Conclusions: STPP is an effective treatment of a broad range of depressive conditions in breast cancer patients improving depression and functional QoL. Findings are limited by the drop-out rate (~1/3) and delayed post-treatment assessments. Future trials may consider stepped-care approaches, tailored to patients' needs and requirements in the acute treatment phase. The Author 2013.

Multiple Sclerosis, 23(8), 1112-1122.";101177;"Background: Depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is common but may stay untreated. Physical limitations impede face-to-face treatment. Internet-based treatment is therefore a promising tool for treating depression in MS. Objectives: To investigate effectiveness of a guided Internet-based problem-solving treatment (IPST) for depressed MS patients. Methods: MS patients with moderate or severe depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to IPST or a wait list control. Primary outcome was the change in depressive symptoms defined by a change in sum score on the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II). Assessments took place at baseline (T0), within a week after the intervention (T1), and at 4 months follow-up (T2). Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Results: A total of 171 patients were randomized to IPST (n = 85) or a wait list control (n = 86). T1 was completed by 152 (89%) and T2 by 131 patients (77%). The IPST group and wait list control showed large significant improvements in depressive symptoms, but no differences were found between groups at T1 (d = 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-4.03, 1.08); p = 0.259) and T2 (d = 0.01; 95% CI = (-2.80, 2.98); p = 0.953).

The ACT intervention is aimed at increasing the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions and living a mindful and value-based life. METHOD: Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to the ACT intervention (n=49) or to a waiting list (n=44). The mean age of the participants was 49 years. The majority of the participants was female and of Dutch origin. All the participants completed measures before and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS), alcohol use and acceptance (AAQ-II). RESULTS: The ACT intervention led to statistically significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (Cohen's d=.60). These reductions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Also significant reductions in anxiety and fatigue were observed. Moreover, mediational analysis showed that the improvement of acceptance during the intervention mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive symptomatology at follow-up. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an early intervention based on ACT, aimed at increasing acceptance, is effective in reducing depressive symptomatology.";"Efficacy of an early intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy for adults with depressive symptomatology: Evaluation in a randomized controlled trial";"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0005796710002202/1-s2.0-S0005796710002202-main.pdf?_tid=89318204-d477-11e4-9a21-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1427457239_8ee32b941eb20b93df338735ddc0bdfd and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0005796710002202/1-s2.0-S0005796710002202-main.pdf?_tid=971a462e-5868-11e5-8935-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1441964374_e8fec43d086a58085d383211216c5445";"Behav Res Ther";"Bohlmeijer, 2011";"Bohlmeijer_2011_3rd_wl_NA_NA_msd_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of group interpersonal psychotherapy in alleviating depression and dysfunction and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting controlled trials in Africa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial (February-June 2002), 30 villages in the Masaka and Rakai districts of rural Uganda were selected using a random procedure; 15 were then randomly assigned for studying men and 15 for women. In each village, adult men or women believed by themselves and other villagers to have depressionlike illness were interviewed using a locally adapted Hopkins Symptom Checklist and an instrument assessing function. Based on these interviews, lists were created for each village totaling 341 men and women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression or subsyndromal depression. Interviewers revisited them in order of decreasing symptom severity until they had 8 to 12 persons per village, totaling 284. Of these, 248 agreed to be in the trial and 9 refused; the remainder died or relocated. A total of 108 men and 116 women completed the study and were reinterviewed. INTERVENTION: Eight of the 15 male villages and 7 of the 15 female villages were randomly assigned to the intervention arm and the remainder to the control arm. The intervention villages received group interpersonal psychotherapy for depression as weekly 90-minute sessions for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression and dysfunction severity scores on scales adapted and validated for local use; proportion of persons meeting DSM-IV major depression diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Mean reduction in depression severity was 17.47 points for intervention groups and 3.55 points for controls (P<.001). Mean reduction in dysfunction was 8.08 and 3.76 points, respectively (P<.001). After intervention, 6.5% and 54.7% of the intervention and control groups, respectively, met the criteria for major depression (P<.001) compared with 86% and 94%, respectively, prior to intervention (P =.04). The odds of postintervention depression among controls was 17.31 (95% confidence interval, 7.63-39.27) compared with the odds among intervention groups. Results from intention-to-treat analyses remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Group interpersonal psychotherapy was highly efficacious in reducing depression and dysfunction. A clinical trial proved feasible in the local setting. Both findings should encourage similar trials in similar settings in Africa and beyond.";"Group interpersonal psychotherapy for depression in rural Uganda: a randomized controlled trial";"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4884/JOC30288.pdf";"Jama";"Bolton, 2003";"Bolton_2003_ipt_cau_NA_NA_msd_hscl-d_clinician_0_post"

Individualized Guided Internet-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Chronic Pain Patients with Comorbid Depression and Anxiety: A Randomized Controlled Trial. Clinical Journal of Pain 2014.";NA;"Objectives: Depression and anxiety are commonly seen in patients with chronic pain which affects the patient's daily life functioning. Although considerable attention has been devoted to explain why depression and anxiety are frequent comorbid with chronic pain, little empirical work has been conducted on interventions that target depression and anxiety and chronic pain. The present study was designed to test an individualized cognitive-behavioral treatment delivered through the internet for persons with chronic pain and emotional distress. Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients with chronic pain and depression were included and randomized to either treatment for 8 weeks or to a control group that participated in a moderated online discussion forum. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses showed significant decreases regarding depressive symptoms and pain disability in the treatment group.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a web-based guided self-help intervention (GET.ON Mood Enhancer) in the treatment of sD. Methods: Participants with sD (n = 406) recruited from the general population via a large health insurance company were randomly allocated to a web-based cognitive behavioural intervention or to enhanced care-as-usual. The primary outcome was the reduction in depressive symptom severity as measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Results: Participants in the intervention group showed a significantly greater pre-post reduction in depressive symptom severity (d = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.86-1.27) compared to the control condition (d = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.10-0.49). The corresponding between-group effect size was d = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49-0.89). At 6-month follow-up the effect was reduced to d = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.09-0.48) but was still statistically significant (F1, 403 = 9.240, p = 0.003). Conclusions: This study lends support to the idea that problem solving coupled with behavioural activation is an effective treatment for sD. In addition, the delivery of this intervention over the Internet might be a promising strategy for the dissemination of psychological interventions for sD on a large scale.";"Effectiveness of a Web-Based Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for Subthreshold Depression: Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L606157077 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000438673 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=14230348&id=doi:10.1159%2F000438673&atitle=Effectiveness+of+a+Web-Based+Cognitive+Behavioural+Intervention+for+Subthreshold+Depression%3A+Pragmatic+Randomised+Controlled+Trial&stitle=Psychother.+Psychosom.&title=Psychotherapy+and+Psychosomatics&volume=84&issue=6&spage=348&epage=358&aulast=Buntrock&aufirst=Claudia&auinit=C.&aufull=Buntrock+C.&coden=PSPSB&isbn=&pages=348-358&date=2015&auinit1=C&auinitm= and http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/438673";"Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics";"Buntrock, 2015";"Buntrock_2015_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA_msd_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

This is the first pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) looking at treating depression by the end of pregnancy. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of delivering a CBT intervention modified for antenatal depression during pregnancy. METHODS: Women in North Bristol, UK between 8-18 weeks pregnant were recruited through routine contact with midwives and randomised to receive up to 12 sessions of individual CBT in addition to usual care or to continue with usual care only. Women were eligible for randomisation if they screened positive on a 3-question depression screen used routinely by midwives and met ICD-10 criteria for depression assessed using the clinical interview schedule - revised version (CIS-R). Two CBT therapists delivered the intervention. Follow-up was at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation when assessments of mental health were made using measures which included the CIS-R. RESULTS: Of the 50 women assessed for the trial, 36 met ICD-10 depression criteria and were randomised: 18 to the intervention and 18 to usual care. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) women who were allocated to receive the intervention completed 9 or more sessions of CBT before the end of pregnancy. Follow-up rates at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation were higher in the group who received the intervention (89% vs. 72% at 15 weeks and 89% vs. 61% at 33 weeks post-randomisation). At 15 weeks post-randomisation (the end of pregnancy), there were more women in the intervention group (11/16; 68.7%) who recovered (i.e. no longer met ICD-10 criteria for depression), than those receiving only usual care (5/13; 38.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial shows the feasibility of conducting a large RCT to assess the effectiveness of CBT for treating antenatal depression before the end of pregnancy.

Methods: Six month-controlled trial of patients who were referred to randomly assigned GPs (four for experimental group of patients and ten for the control) was done. Experimental sample had 34 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of Depression (Depressed Episode, Dysthymia, or Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood) receiving the TAU supplemented with counseling. Control group had 30 patients with diagnosis of Depression receiving only the TAU. Results: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score improved in both groups. Patients in the experimental group showed greater improvement compared to the control group at T2. The World Health Organization Quality OF Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) score also improved in the experimental group but not in the control group. The improvement in the experimental group was statistically significant in terms of both BDI and WHOQOL scores. Conclusions: Adding counseling to TAU in general medical practice settings is more effective in controlling the symptoms of depression and improving the quality of life as measured over a period of six months, than TAU alone. These results while encouraging, also calls for a larger study involving a largersample size and a longer period of time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Effectiveness of a psycho-educational group program for major depression in primary care: A randomized controlled trial. BMC psychiatry. 2012;12:230.";101186;"BACKGROUND: Studies show the effectiveness of group psychoeducation in reducing symptoms in people with depression. However, few controlled studies that have included aspects of personal care and healthy lifestyle (diet, physical exercise, sleep) together with cognitive-behavioral techniques in psychoeducation are proven to be effective.The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a psychoeducational program, which includes aspects of personal care and healthy lifestyle, in patients with mild/moderate depression symptoms in Primary Care (PC). METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial, 246 participants over 20 years old with ICD-10 major depression were recruited through nurses/general practitioners at 12 urban Primary Care Centers (PCCs) in Barcelona. The intervention group (IG) (n=119) received a group psychoeducational program (12 weekly, 1.5 h sessions led by two nurses) and the control group (CG) (n=112) received usual care. Patients were assessed at baseline and at, 3, 6 and 9 months. The main outcome measures were the BDI, EQ-5D and remission based upon the BDI. RESULTS: 231 randomized patients were included, of whom 85 had mild depression and 146 moderate depression. The analyses showed significant differences between groups in relation to remission of symptoms, especially in the mild depression group with a high rate of 57% (p=0.009) at post-treatment and 65% (p=0.006) at 9 month follow up, and only showed significant differences on the BDI at post-treatment (p=0.016; effect size Cohen's d'=.51) and at 6 and 9 month follow-up (p= 0.048; d'=.44).In the overall and moderate sample, the analyses only showed significant differences between groups on the BDI at post-treatment, p=0.02 (d'=.29) and p=0.010 (d'=.47), respectively.The psychoeducation group improved significantly on the EQ-5D at short and long-term. CONCLUSIONS: This psychoeducational intervention is a short and long-term effective treatment for patients with mild depression symptoms. It results in a high remission rate, is recommended in PC and can be carried out by nurses with previous training. In moderate patients, group psychoeducation is effective in the short-term.

The study aimed to examine the effects of the life storybook creation process on depressive symptoms among older community-dwelling Chinese adults in Singapore. A randomised controlled trial was conducted from January 2011 to March 2012. Twenty-six Chinese aged over 60 years, who were able to communicate in Chinese and/or English, and with mild to severe depression were randomly allocated to either the life storybook (intervention) group (n = 14) or the non-life storybook (control) group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were interviewed on a one to one basis on five sessions over 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Generalised estimating equations were used to examine the effects of the intervention on the elderly peoples' depression level. Significant reductions in depression scores were found in the intervention group from baseline (mean 7.9 [SD 3.0]) to week 8 (2.5 [1.7], chi(2) = 15.25, P < 0.001). At week 8, the intervention group showed a lower level of depression than the control (chi(2) = 4.33, P = 0.037). This study supports the life storybook creation process as an effective intervention for depressed older Chinese adults living in the community.

In this randomized controlled study, we systematically evaluated the effects of weekly supportive group meetings for women with postnatal distress. METHODS: Sixty postnatally distressed women were randomly assigned to support (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. Women assigned to the support group participated in four supportive group sessions that comprised discussions concerning transition to motherhood, postnatal stress management, communication skills, and life planning. RESULTS: Subjects who attended the support sessions had significantly decreased scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and significantly increased scores on the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) as evaluated at the end of the fourth weekly session. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the control group during this period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 927 pregnant women in 6 obstetric and gynecology clinics and screened them using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Ninety-nine of the screened women who had significantly high scores in BDI (a score above 16) were selected for the study. They were contacted through by telephone, and 27 who had consented to participate in the study were interviewed via SCID-IV-I. Twenty-seven eligible women were randomly assigned to the CBT intervention (n = 15) and control condition (n = 12). All participants were required to complete written questionnaires, assessing demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms, negative thoughts, dyadic communication satisfaction, and global marital satisfaction prior to treatment and approximately 1 month postpartum. The 15 women in the CBT condition received 9 bi-weekly 1-hour individual CBT sessions, targeting and modifying negative patterns of thinking and behaviors occurring in the context of the dyadic relationship. RESULTS: The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that there were significant differences in all postpartum measures between the 2 groups, indicating that our antenatal intervention with CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving marital satisfaction, which lasted until the postpartum period. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study has provided preliminary empirical evidence that antenatal CBT intervention can be an effective preventive treatment for PPD. Further study in this direction was suggested.";"Antenatal cognitive-behavioral therapy for prevention of postpartum depression: a pilot study";"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2615282/pdf/ymj-49-553.pdf";"Yonsei Med J";"Cho, 2008";"Cho_2008_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

Six sessions of the PST-primary care were conducted for the PST participants. For tele-PST, sessions 2e6 were conducted via Skype video call. Acceptance of tele-PST or in-person PST was measured with the 11-item, 7-point scale modified Treatment Evaluation Inventory (TEI).

JAMA Netw Open. 2020;3(8):e2015648.";101001;"Importance  Older adults who are homebound and have low income have limited access to psychosocial treatments because of their homebound state and geriatric mental health workforce shortages.





Objective  To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a brief, aging serviceâ€“integrated, videoconferenced behavioral activation (tele-BA) treatment delivered by lay counselors compared with videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) delivered by licensed clinicians and attention control (AC; telephone support calls).





Design, Setting, and Participants  This 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of 15 or greater between February 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019. Tele-BA and tele-PST participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020.





Interventions  Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills.





Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, â‰¥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles.





Results  A total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were Black, 81 (29.2%) who were Hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35â€¯000 or less. The mean (SD) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-BA, 93 participants were randomized to tele-PST, and 94 participants were randomized to the AC. Compared with participants in the AC group, participants in the tele-BA and tele-PST groups had significantly higher response and remission rates and medium to large effect sizes (tele-BA: raw growth modeling analysis dâ€‰=â€‰0.62 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; tele-PST: raw growth modeling analysis dâ€‰=â€‰1.00 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.26]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) for HAMD scores.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received tele-BA by lay counselors achieved statistically and clinically meaningful changes in depressive symptoms.

Objective  To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a brief, aging serviceâ€“integrated, videoconferenced behavioral activation (tele-BA) treatment delivered by lay counselors compared with videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) delivered by licensed clinicians and attention control (AC; telephone support calls).





Design, Setting, and Participants  This 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of 15 or greater between February 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019. Tele-BA and tele-PST participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020.





Interventions  Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills.





Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, â‰¥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles.





Results  A total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were Black, 81 (29.2%) who were Hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35â€¯000 or less. The mean (SD) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-BA, 93 participants were randomized to tele-PST, and 94 participants were randomized to the AC. Compared with participants in the AC group, participants in the tele-BA and tele-PST groups had significantly higher response and remission rates and medium to large effect sizes (tele-BA: raw growth modeling analysis dâ€‰=â€‰0.62 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; tele-PST: raw growth modeling analysis dâ€‰=â€‰1.00 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.26]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) for HAMD scores.

Aims: To describe a systematic approach to the development of a brief psychological treatment for patients with severe depression delivered by lay counsellors in primary healthcare. Method: The treatment was developed in three stages using a variety of methods: (a) identifying potential strategies; (b) developing a theoretical framework; and (c) evaluating the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the psychological treatment. Results: The Healthy Activity Program (HAP) is delivered over 6-8 sessions and consists of behavioral activation as the core psychological framework with added emphasis on strategies such as problem-solving and activation of social networks. Key elements to improve acceptability and feasibility are also included. In an intention-to-treat analysis of a pilot randomised controlled trial (55 participants), the prevalence of depression (Beck Depression Inventory II 519) after 2 months was lower in the HAP than the control arm (adjusted risk ratio=0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.94, P= 0.01). Conclusions: Our systematic approach to the development of psychological treatments could be extended to other mental disorders.

Experimental and wait-list control groups were provided with the IRI-HK immediately and 12 weeks after the baseline assessment, respectively. Participants were 114 older adults living in empty nests and recruited via local elderly community centers. This high-risk population with detectable depressive symptoms were randomized into experimental (N = 46) and control (N = 68) groups. The IRI-HK is a group reminiscence intervention modified with cultural adaptations for Chinese older adults. It emphasizes the use of problem-focused coping strategies and comprises six intervention sessions and two follow-up sessions. Participants' depressive symptoms and life satisfaction were measured by the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form and the Life Satisfaction Scale-Chinese, respectively.RESULTS: Findings from this study showed a significant difference in depressive symptoms between groups after the intervention, F(1,77) = 35.62, p <0.001. Life satisfaction of the experimental group after the second follow-up was found to be significantly higher than that of the control group, F(1,68) = 5.67, p <0.05.CONCLUSION: The IRI-HK was a successful cultural adaption suitable for use in the Chinese context.

Our aim was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of a group intervention based on CBT principles for women with depression in primary care. METHODS: Women aged 30 to 55 years were recruited and randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of the group intervention or usual care (control). The group intervention was based on a manual and used CBT and problem solving principles with weekly topics including raising activity levels, spotting and catching negative thoughts, problem solving and relaxation. Women were recruited from deprived areas of Bristol. The groups were run by facilitators with some experience and background in group work and one weeks training in use of the course manual. Assessments of mental health were made using measures including the PHQ-9. Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to support the design of the intervention and to help understand issues of acceptability and feasibility. Interviews were conducted with all participants at baseline and at 3 and 6 months although detailed qualitative analysis was based on a purposive sample of 20 participants at the 3 time points. RESULTS: Of the 86 participants assessed for eligibility, 52 were allocated to the intervention arm and 21 to the control group. The intervention was delivered according to the manual despite the limited training of the facilitators. The intervention was received favourably by participants and facilitators, with good attendance at sessions for those who engaged with the intervention. Follow up rates at 3 and 6 months for women in both the intervention and control arms were also good. The trial methodology used was appropriate and feasible. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a randomised controlled trial of group CBT for women with depression is feasible and the intervention is acceptable, and may possibly prove to be effective in a larger trial. The cost effectiveness of group CBT for depression should be explored further in a full trial.

Effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on depression and sleep quality in painful diabetic neuropathy: a randomized clinical trial. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders. 2020.";101007;"Background


Neuropathic pain is a complicated phenomenon in patients with diabetes. These patients have many problems, especially depression and Sleep disturbance. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on depression and Sleep disturbance in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.





Methods


The current paper was conducted according to the clinical trial method with 50 participants. Participants were separated into intervention and control groups randomly. Based on the diagnosis of neurologists, all participants received standard medications to regulate neuropathic pain. The intervention group received ACT for eight sessions. The results were evaluated in the pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. The tools used were the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Beckâ€™s depression inventory. Statistical analysis includes descriptive statistics, and repeated-measures (ANOVA) conducted by SPSS (version 26) software. Results: Results showed that in the intervention group, the treatment led to improved depressive symptoms (Fâ€‰=â€‰6.81, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Besides, for sleep quality, treatment in all subscales, except for the Hypnotic medicine subscale, significantly improved the intervention groupâ€™s situations. It was also observed that the overall quality of sleep in the ACT group showed a more significant improvement (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). All the above results remained the same until the end of the follow-up period (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).





Conclusion


ACT, as a complementary treatment, can improve the psychiatric symptoms and problems in people with neuropathic pain. Therefore, it is necessary to include psychotherapy services along with medical treatment in outpatient and hospitalization units.";NA;NA;NA;"Davoudi, 2020";"Davoudi_2020_3rd_otherctr_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

Program ACTIVE II was a randomized, controlled, multicenter treatment trial designed to test the comparative effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or community-based exercise (EXER) on diabetes and depression outcomes compared with usual care (UC). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a 22 factorial randomized controlled trial design, adults with T2DM for 1 year who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD were randomized to CBT (10 sessions occurring over 12 weeks; N = 36), EXER (12 weeks of community-based exercise including six sessions with a personal trainer; N = 34), CBT+EXER (concurrent over a 12-week period; N = 34), and UC (N = 36). Primary outcomes were depression remission rate (assessed by psychiatric interviewers blind to assignment) and change in glycemic control (HbA1c). RESULTS Themean age was 56.0 years (SD 10.7). Participants were female (77%), white (71%), and married (52%). After controlling for education and antidepressant use, odds of achieving full MDD remission in the intervention groups were 5.0-6.8 times greater than UC (P < 0.0167). The CBT+EXER group demonstrated improved HbA1c compared with UC. For participants with a baseline HbA1c 7.0%, exploratory post hoc subgroup analysis showed that the CBT+EXER group had a 1.1% improvement in HbA1c (P < 0.0001) after controlling for covariates.

We tested the effects of a brief cognitive therapy intervention on depressive symptoms, negative thinking, health-related quality of life, and cardiac event-free survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hospitalized patients with depressive symptoms (n = 41, 66 +/- 11 years, 45% female, 81% New York Heart Association Class III/IV) were randomly assigned to control group or a brief, nurse-delivered cognitive therapy intervention, delivered during hospitalization and followed by a 1-week booster phone call. Depressive symptoms, negative thinking, and health-related quality of life were measured at 1 week and 3 months. Cardiac event-free survival was assessed at 3 months. Mixed models repeated measures analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression were used for data analysis. There were significant improvements in depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life in both groups but no interactions between group and time. The control group had shorter 3-month cardiac event-free survival (40% versus 80%, P < .05) and a 3.5 greater hazard of experiencing a cardiac event (P = .04) than the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Nurses can deliver a brief intervention to hospitalized patients with heart failure that may improve short-term, event-free survival.

Postpartum depression and anxiety are under-addressed public health problems with numerous treatment access barriers, including insufficiently available mental health specialist providers.





Aims


To examine the effectiveness of nurse-delivered telephone interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for postpartum depression. Trial registration ISRCTN88987377.





Method


Postpartum women (n = 241) with major depression (on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)) from 36 Canadian public health regions in rural and urban settings were randomly assigned to 12 weekly 60 min nurse-delivered telephone-IPT sessions or standard locally available care. The primary outcome was the proportion of women clinically depressed at 12 weeks post-randomisation, with masked intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes examined included comorbid anxiety, self-reported attachment and partner relationship quality.





Results


At 12 weeks, 10.6% of women in the IPT group (11/104) and 35% in the control group (35/100) remained depressed (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.10â€“0.46), with the IPT group 4.5 times less likely to be clinically depressed (SCID); 21.2% in the IPT group and 51% in the control group had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score >12 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.14â€“0.48), and attachment avoidance decreased more in the IPT group than in the control group (P = 0.02). Significant differences favoured the IPT group for comorbid anxiety and partner relationship quality at all time points, with no differences in health service or antidepressant use. None of the IPT responders relapsed by 36 weeks. Between-group SCID differences were sustained at 24 weeks, but not at 36 weeks.





Conclusions


Nurse-delivered telephone IPT is an effective treatment for diverse urban and rural women with postpartum depression and anxiety that can improve treatment access disparities.";NA;NA;NA;"Dennis, 2020";"Dennis_2020_ipt_cau_NA_NA_msd_epds_self-report_0_post"

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy in moderate to severe depression of antidepressant medications with cognitive therapy in a placebo-controlled trial. DESIGN: Random assignment to one of the following: 16 weeks of medications (n = 120), 16 weeks of cognitive therapy (n = 60), or 8 weeks of pill placebo (n = 60). SETTING: Research clinics at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty outpatients, aged 18 to 70 years, with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Some study subjects received paroxetine, up to 50 mg daily, augmented by lithium carbonate or desipramine hydrochloride if necessary; others received individual cognitive therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale provided continuous severity scores and allowed for designations of response and remission. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, response rates in medications (50%) and cognitive therapy (43%) groups were both superior to the placebo (25%) group. Analyses based on continuous scores at 8 weeks indicated an advantage for each of the active treatments over placebo, each with a medium effect size. The advantage was significant for medication relative to placebo, and at the level of a nonsignificant trend for cognitive therapy relative to placebo. At 16 weeks, response rates were 58% in each of the active conditions; remission rates were 46% for medication, 40% for cognitive therapy. Follow-up tests of a site x treatment interaction indicated a significant difference only at Vanderbilt University, where medications were superior to cognitive therapy. Site differences in patient characteristics and in the relative experience levels of the cognitive therapists each appear to have contributed to this interaction. CONCLUSION: Cognitive therapy can be as effective as medications for the initial treatment of moderate to severe major depression, but this degree of effectiveness may depend on a high level of therapist experience or expertise.";"Cognitive therapy vs medications in the treatment of moderate to severe depression";"http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/PSYCH/5213/yoa30320.pdf";"Arch Gen Psychiatry";"DeRubeis, 2005";"DeRubeis_2005_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA_remission(cut-off)_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 85(1), 26-36";101037;"Objective: Depression among pregnant women is a prevalent public health problem associated with poor maternal and offspring development. Behavioral activation (BA) is a scalable intervention aligned with pregnant women's preference for nonpharmacological depression care. This is the first test of the effectiveness of BA for depression among pregnant women, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BA as compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Method: Pregnant women (mean age = 28.75 years; SD = 5.67) with depression symptoms were randomly assigned to BA (n = 86) or TAU (n = 77). Exclusion criteria included known bipolar or psychotic disorder or immediate self-harm risk. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 and 10 weeks postrandomization and 3 months postpartum using self-report measures of primary and secondary outcomes and putative targets. Results: Compared with TAU, BA was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms (d = 0.34, p =.04) and higher remission (56.3% vs. 30.3%, p =.003). BA also demonstrated significant advantage on anxiety and perceived stress. Participants attended most BA sessions and reported high satisfaction. Participants in BA reported significantly higher levels of activation (d = 0.69, p <.0002) and environmental reward (d = 0.54, p <.003) than those who received TAU, and early change in both of these putative targets significantly mediated subsequent depression outcomes. Conclusions: BA is effective for pregnant women, offering significant depression, anxiety, and stress benefits, with mediation analyses supporting the importance of putative targets of activation and environmental reward.

The comorbidity of depression and migraine is a major health concern as it results in poorer prognosis and quality of life. Yet, effective treatments have rarely been investigated. Method: 45 patients with comorbid migraine and depression were assigned to a 1-day Acceptance and Commitment Training plus Migraine Education workshop (ACT-ED; N = 31) or to Wait List/Treatment as Usual (WL/TAU; N = 14). Assessment of depressive symptoms, general functioning, and migraine related disability were completed at baseline and 2-, 6-, and 12 weeks after the workshop. Results: At the 3-month follow up, participants in the ACT-ED condition exhibited significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, general functioning, and migraine-related disability than patients in the WL/TAU group.

The comorbidity of depression and migraine is a major health concern as it results in poorer prognosis and quality of life. Yet, effective treatments have rarely been investigated. Method: 45 patients with comorbid migraine and depression were assigned to a 1-day Acceptance and Commitment Training plus Migraine Education workshop (ACT-ED; N = 31) or to Wait List/Treatment as Usual (WL/TAU; N = 14). Assessment of depressive symptoms, general functioning, and migraine related disability were completed at baseline and 2-, 6-, and 12 weeks after the workshop. Results: At the 3-month follow up, participants in the ACT-ED condition exhibited significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, general functioning, and migraine-related disability than patients in the WL/TAU group.

Methods Seventy-two people with PD (PWP) were randomized to T-CBT + TAU or TAU only. T-CBT tailored to PWPsâ€™ unique needs was provided weekly for 3 months, then monthly during 6-month follow-up. CBT targeted negative thoughts (e.g., â€œI have no controlâ€<9d>; â€œI am helplessâ€<9d>) and behaviors (e.g., social withdrawal, excessive worry). It also trained care partners to help PWP practice healthy habits. Blind raters assessed outcomes at baseline, midtreatment, treatment end, and 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Analyses were intent to treat.





Results T-CBT outperformed TAU on all depression, anxiety, and quality of life measures. The primary outcome (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score) improved significantly in T-CBT compared to TAU by treatment end. Mean improvement from baseline was 6.53 points for T-CBT and âˆ’0.27 points for TAU (p < 0.0001); gains persisted over 6-month follow-up (p < 0.0001).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate early cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a home environment in patients recovering from cardiac surgery. METHODS: : From July 2006 through October 2009, we conducted a randomized controlled trial and enrolled 808 patients who were screened for depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in the hospital and 1 month later. Patients were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; those who met criteria for clinical depression (n = 81) were randomized to CBT (n = 45) or usual care (UC; n = 36). After completion of the UC period, 25 individuals were offered later CBT (UC + CBT). RESULTS: Main outcomes (depressive symptoms [BDI] and clinical depression [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]) were evaluated after 8 weeks using intention-to-treat principles and linear mixed models. Compared with the UC group, in the CBT group, there was greater decline in BDI scores (beta = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-2.02; P = < .001) and greater remission of clinical depression (29 [64%] vs 9 [25%]; number need to treat, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9; P < .001). Compared with the early CBT group (median time from surgery to CBT, 45.5 days) the later UC + CBT group (median time from surgery to CBT, 122 days) also experienced a reduction in BDI scores, but the group x time effect was smaller (beta = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.10-1.47; P = .03) and remission rates between the 2 groups did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Early home CBT is effective in depressed postcardiac surgery patients. Early treatment is associated with greater symptom reduction than similar therapy given later after surgery.";"Early cognitive behavioral therapy for depression after cardiac surgery";"http://graphics.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCDCGCPFGC00/fs046/ovft/live/gv025/00005082/00005082-201307000-00009.pdf";"J Cardiovasc Nurs";"Doering, 2013";"Doering_2013_cbt_cau_NA_NA_remission(cut-off)_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of telephone-based reminiscence therapy on the depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and social support of colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression. METHODS: Patients were divided randomly into a control group (CON, n=45), telephone support group (TS, n=45), and telephone-based reminiscence therapy group (TBR, n=45). Patients in TS and TBR groups received six 20-40-min telephone intervention sessions conducted weekly. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6weeks. The primary outcomes were changes on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which were used to evaluate depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes were changes in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) scores, which were used to evaluate anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being, and social support, respectively. RESULTS: After 6weeks, SDS and HAMD scores were significantly lower than pre-intervention baseline in the TBR group but not in the CON and TS groups (P<0.05). Both SAS and HAMA scores were significantly reduced in TBR and TS groups but not the CON group (P<0.05) following intervention; however, there was no significant difference in post-intervention scores between TS and TBR groups (P>0.05). Neither telephone support nor telephone-based reminiscence therapy improved subjective well-being or social support (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that telephone-based reminiscence therapy can reduce depression symptoms in colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy. Telephone-based reminiscence therapy may also improve anxiety, but no better than telephone support. Alternatively, telephone-based reminiscence therapy did not improve subjective well-being or social support. We suggest that clinicians provide appropriate telephone-based reminiscence therapy in long-term care institutions based on patient mental health status.";"Telephone-based reminiscence therapy for colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression: a three-arm randomised controlled trial";"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30515573 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00520-018-4566-6";"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer";"Dong, 2019";"Dong_2019_lrt_cau_NA_NA_msd_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of telephone-based reminiscence therapy on the depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and social support of colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression. METHODS: Patients were divided randomly into a control group (CON, n=45), telephone support group (TS, n=45), and telephone-based reminiscence therapy group (TBR, n=45). Patients in TS and TBR groups received six 20-40-min telephone intervention sessions conducted weekly. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6weeks. The primary outcomes were changes on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which were used to evaluate depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes were changes in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) scores, which were used to evaluate anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being, and social support, respectively. RESULTS: After 6weeks, SDS and HAMD scores were significantly lower than pre-intervention baseline in the TBR group but not in the CON and TS groups (P<0.05). Both SAS and HAMA scores were significantly reduced in TBR and TS groups but not the CON group (P<0.05) following intervention; however, there was no significant difference in post-intervention scores between TS and TBR groups (P>0.05). Neither telephone support nor telephone-based reminiscence therapy improved subjective well-being or social support (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that telephone-based reminiscence therapy can reduce depression symptoms in colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy. Telephone-based reminiscence therapy may also improve anxiety, but no better than telephone support. Alternatively, telephone-based reminiscence therapy did not improve subjective well-being or social support. We suggest that clinicians provide appropriate telephone-based reminiscence therapy in long-term care institutions based on patient mental health status.";"Telephone-based reminiscence therapy for colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression: a three-arm randomised controlled trial";"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30515573 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00520-018-4566-6";"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer";"Dong, 2019";"Dong_2019_lrt_cau_NA_NA_msd_sds_self-report_0_post"

AIMS: To examine whether generic mental health workers can deliver effective behavioural activation as a step-three high-intensity intervention. METHOD: A randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN27045243) comparing behavioural activation (n=24) with treatment as usual (n=23) in primary care. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated a difference in favour of behavioural activation of -15.79 (95% CI -24.55 to -7.02) on the Beck Depression Inventory-II and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (mean difference -11.12, 95% CI -17.53 to -4.70).

METHOD: The study was undertaken at an acute psychiatric assessment and treatment centre based in the community. The centre operates an open referral system. The study sample was taken from clients attending the centre for mental health assessment who were subsequently diagnosed with unipolar depression. The total sample of 38 clients were allocated to either a treatment group (n = 19) or waiting list control group (n = 19) matching for age, gender and social support. The treatment group was divided into four groups. Each of these groups received 12 sessions of CBT, derived from the procedures described by Beck et al (1979). Data from dysfunctional thought diaries and Beck depression inventory scores were analysed. RESULTS: The results confirm those of previous outcome studies, that CBT is an effective treatment for depression. The results also indicate some interesting points relating to the expression of negative emotions as depression scores improve. It appeared that the expression of sadness preceded the expression of anger. Expression of sadness may be a precursor to expression of anger and necessary for recovery from depression. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that dimensions of an individual's personality, such as perfectionism and sociotrophy, may be influential in determining the outcomes of CBT. Further research in this area is indicated.";"The effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in depression";NA;"Nurs Stand";"Embling, 2002";"Embling_2002_cbt_wl_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

The primary outcome measure was depression symptoms as measured using Beck's Depression Inventory. Repeated-measures ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U Test were used for data analysis. Results show that exposing inmates to the group-focused cognitive-behavioral coaching program significantly reduced the depressive symptoms of inmates in the treatment group compared with those in the control group.

Journal of Affective Disorders. 2008;108(1-2):159-64.";101016;"BACKGROUND: Infertility is a stressful event that can give rise to psychological difficulties. Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are well-established treatments for depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy with fluoxetine in the resolution or decreasing of depression and anxiety in infertile women. METHOD: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 89 mild to moderate depressed infertile women (Beck scores 10-47) were recruited into three groups; cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), antidepressant therapy, and a control group. Twenty-nine participants in the CBT method received relaxation training, restructuring, and eliminating of negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes to depression for 10 sessions. Thirty participants in the pharmacotherapy group took 20 mg fluoxetine daily for 90 days. Thirty control subjects did not receive any intervention. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory and Cattell Anxiety Inventory at the beginning and end of the study. Chi2 test, paired t-test, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The resolution of depression in the three groups was: fluoxetine group 50%, CBT 79.3%, and control 10%. The mean of the Beck scores at the beginning and end of the study was respectively: fluoxetine 23.2+/-8.6 versus 14.3+/-8.5(p<0.001), CBT 20.1+/-7.9 versus 7.7+/-4.8 (p<0.001), and control 19.8+/-8.5 versus 19.7+/-8.4 (p=0.9). Although both fluoxetine and CBT decreased significantly the mean of BDI scores more than that of the control group, the decrease in the CBT group was significantly more than fluoxetine group. The CBT method decreased significantly the mean of the Cattell scores more than the fluoxetine and control groups, but the decrease in the anxiety mean scores of that fluoxetine group was no more than that of control group. CONCLUSION: CBT was not only a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy but also was superior to fluoxetine in the resolution or reducing of depression and anxiety of infertile women. Fluoxetine was superior to no therapy in the treatment of depression but not anxiety.";"Treatment of depression and anxiety in infertile women: cognitive behavioral therapy versus fluoxetine";"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S016503270700328X/1-s2.0-S016503270700328X-main.pdf?_tid=5bcbaa3a-586e-11e5-8235-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1441966851_1b8f2128485c6b6c262b04334be119f8";"J Affect Disord";"Faramarzi, 2008";"Faramarzi_2008_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

METHOD: Participants with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were recruited from the general population and randomized to the self-help programme with extensive email support (n=125), the self-help programme with minimal email support (n=125) or to a waiting list control group (n=126). Participants completed measures before and after the intervention to assess depression, anxiety, fatigue, experiential avoidance, positive mental health and mindfulness. Participants in the experimental conditions also completed these measures at a 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: In the experimental conditions significant reductions in depression, anxiety, fatigue, experiential avoidance and improvements in positive mental health and mindfulness were found, compared with the waiting list condition (effect sizes Cohen's d=0.51-1.00).

Patients (N=129) were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to the two treatment conditions. They were assessed at 6-monthly intervals during the 18 months of treatment and at 24, 30 and 42 months during follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), with complete remission defined as a HDRS-17 score 8, and partial remission defined as a HDRS-17 score 12. Secondary outcome measures included self-reported depression as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory - II, social functioning as evaluated by the Global Assessment of Functioning, subjective wellbeing as rated by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure, and satisfaction with general activities as assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire.

Covariate-adjusted Hamilton scores were lower in the cognitive behavior therapy (mean [standard error], 5.5 [1.0]) and the supportive stress-management (7.8 [1.0]) arms than in the usual care arm (10.7 [1.0]) at 3 months. The differences narrowed at 6 months, but the remission rates differed again at 9 months (73%, 57%, and 35%, respectively; chi(2)(2) = 12.02, P = .003). Cognitive behavior therapy was superior to usual care at most points on secondary measures of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, stress, and quality of life. Supportive stress management was superior to usual care only on some of the measures. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavior therapy and supportive stress management are efficacious for treating depression after coronary artery bypass surgery, relative to usual care. Cognitive behavior therapy had greater and more durable effects than supportive stress management on depression and several secondary psychological outcomes.

The Lancet Psychiatry, 6(2), 115-127. doi:10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30466-8";101016;"Background: The Thinking Healthy Programme (THP) is a psychological intervention recommended for the treatment of perinatal depression. However, efforts to integrate the intervention at scale into the routines of community health workers who delivered the THP when it was first evaluated were compromised by the competing responsibilities of community health workers. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of THP peer-delivered (THPP) in Goa, India. Methods: In this single-blind, individually randomised controlled trial, we recruited pregnant women aged 18 years or older who scored at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from antenatal clinics in Goa. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive enhanced usual care (EUC; so-called because, in India, perinatal depression is not typically treated) only (control group) or THPP in addition to EUC (intervention group) in randomly sized blocks that were stratified by area of residence (urban or rural). Group allocations were concealed from participants and researchers before assignments were made by use of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcomes were the severity of depressive symptoms (assessed by PHQ-9 score) and the prevalence of remission (defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5) in participants with available data 6 months after childbirth, which was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocations. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, adjusting for covariates that were defined a priori or that showed imbalance at baseline. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02104232. Findings: Between Oct 24, 2014, and June 24, 2016, we assessed 118 260 women for their eligibility for screening, of whom 111 851 (946%) women were ineligible. 6409 (54%) women were eligible for screening and 6369 (994%) of these women consented to be screened with the PHQ-9 (40 women did not consent), of whom 333 (52%) screened positive for depression (defined as a PHQ-9 score of at least 10). We enrolled 280 (841%) women with perinatal depression; 140 women were assigned to the THPP and EUC group and 140 women to the EUC only group. The final treatment was given on May 27, 2017. The final 6-month outcome assessment was completed on June 9, 2017. At 6 months after birth, 122 (87%) women in the THPP and EUC group and 129 (92%) women in the EUC only group were assessed for the primary outcome. There was a higher prevalence of remission at 6 months after birth in the THPP and EUC group compared with the EUC only group (89 [73%] women in the intervention group vs 77 [60%] women in the control group; prevalence ratio 121, 95% CI 101 to 145; p = 004), but there was no evidence of a difference in symptom severity between the groups (mean PHQ-9 score 347 [SD 449] in the intervention group vs 448 [511] in the control group; standardised mean difference 018, 95% CI 043 to 007; p = 016). There was no evidence of significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups. Interpretation: THPP had a moderate effect on remission from perinatal depression over the 6-month postnatal period. THPP is relatively cheap to deliver and is cost-saving through reduced health-care, time and productivity costs.

Telephone cognitive-behavioral therapy for subthreshold depression and presenteeism in workplace: A randomized controlled trial. PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35330.";101371;"BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in the general population and causes great loss to society especially in the form of reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism). We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT). METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study. RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05).

PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35330.";101371;"BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in the general population and causes great loss to society especially in the form of reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism). We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT). METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study. RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60). The BDI-II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months (p<0.001, Effect size = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.32 to 1.05). However, there was no statistically significant decrease in absolute and relative presenteeism (p = 0.44, ES = 0.15, -0.21 to 0.52, and p = 0.50, ES = 0.02, -0.34 to 0.39, respectively).

The treatment of depression Is limited by the scarcity of mental health professionals, as reflected In the mental health atlas of the World Health Organization. Method: A randomised controlled trial that was not blinded was conducted. Family doctors referred patients older than 60 years who were suspected to hove depression to the screening module. The PHQ-9 questionnaire, the Six-Item Screener, and previous diagnosis for psychiatric disorders were collected. Major depression was excluded. Those with 0 score from two to six on the PHQ-9 and with no comorbidities were referred to the Baseline Phase. A simple random process without blocking was applied. Groups of 7-10 participants engaged In weekly sessions over the course of three months. The control group was referred to their family physician. Reduction In depression score of the PHQ-9 was the main outcome. Results and discussion: There were 40 patients In the control group (CG) and 41 in the Intervention group (IG). 84% were women, 4 1% married and 4 1% reported at least primary education. The mean age for the GC was 69.7 years vs. 71.3 in the Gl. The baseline mean MMSE score was 23.7 In the GC and 24.1 In the IG. No significant baseline differences between groups were reported. In the IG, 56% of the participants (n=23) displayed a decrease that was greater than or equal to 5 points on the PHQ-9 compared with 30% (n = l 2) In the control group.

The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. Treating employees with depressive symptoms before sick leave via the Internet could be beneficial and cost saving. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed and tested the effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms. We report on the posttreatment effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based guided self-help course to care as usual (CAU). We recruited employees from 6 different companies via the companies' intranet and posters. The main inclusion criterion was elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score of >/=16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The intervention (Happy@Work) was based on problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy and consisted of 6 weekly lessons. Participants were asked to submit their weekly assignment via the website after completion. They subsequently received feedback from a coach via the website. Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), anxiety measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), burnout measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and work performance measured by the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ; secondary outcomes) were completed at baseline and at posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or CAU (n=115).The posttreatment assessment was completed by 171 (74.0%) participants. Both the intervention and the CAU group showed significant improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptoms, but no differences between the conditions was found (d=0.16, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.41, P=.29). Significant but small effects in favor of the intervention group were found for anxiety symptoms (d=0.16, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.42, P=.04) and exhaustion (d=0.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.43, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms among employees than CAU.

At 4 months, participants in the intervention group showed reduced depression severity (difference in mean change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score from baseline, -2.9 [95% CI, -4.6 to -1.2]; difference in mean change in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score from baseline, -3.7 [CI, -5.4 to -2.1]); improved depression knowledge, quality of life, behavioral activation, and anxiety (P < 0.001); and improved function (P = 0.014) compared with wait-list participants. More intervention than wait-list participants entered remission at 4 months (43.8% vs. 26.9%). After treatment, control participants showed benefits similar in magnitude to those of participants in the initial intervention group. Those in the initial intervention group maintained benefits at 8 months. LIMITATION: The study had a small sample, short duration, and differential withdrawal rate.

This study tested Perinatal Dyadic Psychotherapy (PDP), a dual-focused mother-infant intervention to prevent/decrease maternal postpartum depression and improve aspects of the mother-infant relationship related to child development. Women recruited from hospital postpartum units were screened using a three-stage process. Forty-two depressed first-time mothers and their 6-week-old infants were enrolled and randomized to receive the PDP intervention or usual care plus depression monitoring by phone. The intervention consisted of eight home-based, nurse-delivered mother-infant sessions consisting of (a) supportive, relationship-based, mother-infant psychotherapy, and (b) a developmentally based infant-oriented component focused on promoting positive mother-infant interactions. Data collected at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up included measures of maternal depression, anxiety, maternal self-esteem, parenting stress, and mother-infant interaction. Depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnoses decreased significantly, and maternal self-esteem increased significantly across the study time frame with no between-group differences. There were no significant differences between groups on parenting stress or mother-infant interaction at post-intervention and follow-up. No participants developed onset of postpartum depression during the course of the study. PDP holds potential for treating depression in the context of the mother-infant relationship; however, usual care plus depression monitoring showed equal benefit. Further research is needed to explore using low-intensity interventions as a first step in a stepped care approach and to determine what subset of at-risk or depressed postpartum mothers might benefit most from the PDP intervention.";"Perinatal Dyadic Psychotherapy for postpartum depression: a randomized controlled pilot trial";"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/119/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00737-014-0483-y.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00737-014-0483-y&token2=exp=1452255870~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F119%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00737-014-0483-y.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00737-014-0483-y*~hmac=7cacfba4f4d3528289bbe255b1a21d37b9da9a46343f1832eb81ad55f81e4cb0";"Arch Womens Ment Health";"Goodman, 2015";"Goodman_2015_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA_msd_epds_self-report_0_post"

Thirty-one university students with moderate depression participated in this study. After the participants were randomly assigned to and control groups, group therapies were conducted for 11 sessions over a period lasting nearly 3 months. The control group received no treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) were administered to the participants at three different occasions: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. A 3 null 3 ANOVA was used to examine the effectiveness of the treatments.

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) and the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) were administered to the participants at three different occasions: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.

Eighty-four university students were recruited and assigned randomly to control and intervention groups. Intervention impact was assessed on measures of depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and coping strategies at three time points; baseline, postintervention, and 3-months postintervention. The interventional model used was the Modified Teaching Kids to Cope (MTKC), and the control group received no treatment. Overall, using CBT showed a significant improvement in the outcome measures. At postintervention, students had lower scores on perceived stress, lower depressive symptoms, less use of avoidance coping strategies, and more use of approach coping strategies. The findings are discussed in terms of treatment implications and recommendations for use at academic and health care settings.";"Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on depressive symptomatology, stress and coping strategies among Jordanian university students";NA;"Issues Ment Health Nurs";"Hamdan-Mansour, 2009";"Hamdan-Mansour_2009_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

This randomized clinical trial tested whether telephone-administered interpersonal psychotherapy (tele-IPT) acutely relieved depressive symptoms in 132 HIV-infected rural persons from 28 states diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV major depressive disorder (MDD), partially remitted MDD, or dysthymic disorder. Patients were randomized to either 9 sessions of one-on-one tele-IPT (n = 70) or standard care (SC; n = 62). A series of intent-to-treat (ITT), therapy completer, and sensitivity analyses assessed changes in depressive symptoms, interpersonal problems, and social support from pre- to postintervention. Across all analyses, tele-IPT patients reported significantly lower depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems than SC controls; 22% of tele-IPT patients were categorized as a priori 'responders' who reported 50% or higher reductions in depressive symptoms compared to only 4% of SC controls in ITT analyses.

Evidence-based treatment recommendations need to be derived directly from this diagnostically heterogeneous group. The primary aim was to assess the efficacy of sertraline and cognitive-behavioural group therapy for treatment of depressed primary-care patients, the secondary aim was to evaluate if receiving treatment according to free choice is associated with a better outcome than randomization to a particular treatment. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, 10-wk trial with five arms: sertraline (flexible dosages up to 200 mg/d) (n = 83); placebo (n = 83); manual-guided cognitive-behavioural group therapy (one individual session and nine group sessions per 90 min) (n = 61); guided self-help group (control condition, n = 59); and treatment with sertraline or cognitive-behavioural group therapy according to patients' choice (n = 82). From 1099 consecutively screened adult patients, 368 formed the intent-to-treat population with milder forms of depression. Primary outcome was a global efficacy measure combining z-converted Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and clinician-rated Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology scores. Sertraline was superior to placebo (p = 0.03). Outcome for guided self-help groups was worse compared to cognitive-behavioural group therapy (p = 0.002) and compared to all other treatment arms including pill placebo (secondary analyses). Outcome in the patients' choice arm was similar to that in the sertraline and cognitive-behavioural group therapy. Overall, sertraline is efficacious in primary-care patients with milder forms of depression. The superiority of cognitive-behavioural group therapy over guided self-help groups might partly be explained by 'nocebo' effects of the latter.";"Effects of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in depressed primary-care patients: a randomized, controlled trial including a patients' choice arm";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/815/CN-00728815/frame.html and http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/content/ijnp/13/1/31.full.pdf";"International journal of neuropsychopharmacology";"Hegerl, 2010";"Hegerl_2010_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA_response(50%&cut-off)_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

Psychosomatic Medicine. 2016;78(6):704-15.";101097;"Background: Depression predicts adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but previous treatment trials yielded mixed results. We tested the hypothesis that stepwise psychotherapy improves depressive symptoms more than simple information. Methods: In a multicenter trial, we randomized 570 CAD patients scoring higher than 7 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale to usual care plus either one information session (UC-IS) or stepwise psychotherapy (UC-PT). UC-PT patients received three individual psychotherapy sessions. Those still depressed were offered group psychotherapy (25 sessions). The primary outcome was changed in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression scores from baseline to 18 months. Preplanned subgroup analyses examined whether treatment responses differed by patients' sex and personality factors (Type D). Results: The mean (standard deviation) depression scores declined from 10.4 (2.5) to 8.7 (4.1) at 18 months in UC-PT and from 10.4 (2.5) to 8.9 (3.9) in UC-IS (both p < .001). There was no significant group difference in change of depressive symptoms (group-by-time effect, p = .90). Preplanned subgroup analyses revealed no differences in treatment effects between men versus women (ptreatment-by-sex interaction = .799) but a significant treatment-by-Type D interaction on change in depressive symptoms (p = .026) with a trend for stronger improvement with UC-PT than UC-IS in Type D patients (n = 341, p = .057) and no such difference in improvement in patients without Type D (n = 227, p = .54). Conclusions: Stepwise psychotherapy failed to improve depressive symptoms in CAD patients more than UC-IS. The intervention might be beneficial for depressed CAD patients with Type D personality.

Research supports the effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression; however, few trials have studied the effect of the MoodGYM program plus therapist support. The use of such interventions could improve the delivery of treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a guided Web-based intervention for mild to moderate depression, which could be suitable for implementation in general practice. METHODS: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition comprising 6 weeks of therapist-assisted Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or to a 6-week delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, brief face-to-face support from a psychologist, and reminder emails. The primary outcome measure, depression symptoms, was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D). All outcomes were based on self-report and were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Postintervention measures were completed by 37 (71%) and 47 (87%) of the 52 participants in the intervention and 54 participants in the delayed treatment group, respectively. Linear mixed-models analyses revealed a significant difference in time trends between the groups for the BDI-II, (P=.002), for HADS depression and anxiety subscales (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively), and for the SWLS (P<.001). No differential group effects were found for the BAI and the EQ-5D. In comparison to the control group, significantly more participants in the intervention group experienced recovery from depression as measured by the BDI-II. Of the 52 participants in the treatment program, 31 (60%) adhered to the program, and overall treatment satisfaction was high. The reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms was largely maintained at 6-month follow-up, and positive gains in life satisfaction were partly maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention combining MoodGYM and brief therapist support can be an effective treatment of depression in a sample of primary care patients. The intervention alleviates depressive symptoms and has a significant positive effect on anxiety symptoms and satisfaction with life. Moderate rates of nonadherence and predominately positive evaluations of the treatment also indicate the acceptability of the intervention. The intervention could potentially be used in a stepped-care approach, but remains to be tested in regular primary health care.

Design - controlled, random order trial. Setting - Health centres in Edinburgh and Livingston. Patients - Sixty women identified as depressed by screening at six weeks post partum and by psychiatric interview at about 13 weeks post partum. Five women did not wish to participate, and a further five did not complete the trial. Age, social and obstetrics factors, and diagnosis were similar in women who completed the trial and those who withdrew. Intervention - Eight weekly counselling visits by health visitors who had been given a short training in counselling for postnatal depression. End point - Reduction of depression. Measurements and main results - Standardised psychiatric interviews and a 10 point self report scale were used to identify depression before and after intervention. The psychiatrist was not told to which group women were allocated. After three months 18 (69%) of the 26 women in the treatment group had fully recovered compared with nine (38%) of the 24 in the control group. The difference between the groups was thus 32% (95% confidence interval 5 to 58).

Aims: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 1-day cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT) self-confidence workshops in reducing depression. Anxiety, self-esteem, prognostic indicators as well as access were also assessed. Method: An open randomised controlled trial (RCT) waiting list control design with 12-week follow-up was used (trial registration: ISRCTN26634837). A total of 459 adult participants with depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores of 14) self-referred and 382 participants (83%) were followed up. Results: At follow-up, experimental and control participants differed significantly on the BDI, with an effect size of 0.55. Anxiety and self-esteem also differed. Of those who participated, 25% were GP non-consulters and 32% were from Black and minority ethnic groups. Women benefited more than men on depression scores. The intervention has a 90% chance of being considered cost-effective if a depression-free day is valued at 14. Conclusions: Self-confidence workshops appear promising in terms of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and access by difficult-to-engage groups.

Methods: A controlled trial was conducted to compare patients who received the behavioural intervention with untreated controls on measures of health outcomes. A total of 31 intervention group participants and 30 controls were selected from patients that met the inclusion criteria from a hospital-based endocrinology outpatient department. The outcome measures including depressive symptoms, glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, BMI, and both physical and mental quality of life were collected before (T1), after (T2), and after 90 days (T3) following the intervention. Results: The experimental group showed a significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, and depressive symptoms and a significant increase in physical quality of life and mental quality of life at T2 and T3, while patients in the control group with usual care showed no changes over time. Conclusion: The behavioural intervention facilitated a significant improvement in psychological adjustment and glycemic control, thus strengthening diabetes control skills and leading to healthy outcomes. It is feasible that nurses and psychiatrists can deliver the behavioural intervention for diabetes patients to decrease their depressive symptoms. Sharing discussion and problem-solving experiences is particularly helpful method for self-control, and these will be beneficially influential on further research.

Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) has shown to be effective in older depressive patients living in the community. To date, CBT has not been applied to older patients with acute physical illness and comorbid depression. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in depressed geriatric patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness. Design Randomized controlled trial with waiting list control group. Setting Postdischarge intervention in a geriatric day clinic; follow-up evaluations at the patients homes. Participants A total of 155 randomized patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness, aged 826years and suffering from depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores >7]. Exclusion criteria were dementia, delirium, and terminal state of medical illness. Intervention Fifteen, weekly group sessions based on a CBT manual. Commencement of psychotherapy immediately after discharge in the intervention group and a 4-month waiting list interval with usual care in the control group. Measurements HADS depression total score after 4months. Secondary endpoints were functional, cognitive, psychosocial and physical status, resource utilization, caregiver burden, and amount of contact with physician. Results The intervention group improved significantly in depression scores (HADS baseline 18.8; after 4months 11.4), whereas the control group deteriorated (HADS baseline 18.1; after 4months 21.6). Significant improvement in the intervention group, but not in the control group, was observed for most secondary outcome parameters such as the Barthel and Karnofsky indexes. Intervention effects were less pronounced in patients with cognitive impairment or acute fractures. Conclusions CBT is feasible and highly effective in geriatric patients. The benefits extend beyond effective recovery and include improvement in physical and functional parameters. Early diagnosis, good access to psychotherapy, and early intervention could improve care for depressive older patients.

To meet the call for more ""transportable"" interventions, we conducted a pilot study to test a group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and substance use that was designed for delivery by outpatient substance abuse treatment counselors. Seventy-three outpatient clients were randomized to usual care enhanced with group CBT or usual care alone and assessed at three time points (baseline and 3 and 6 months postbaseline). Our results demonstrated that the treatment was acceptable and feasible for delivery by substance abuse treatment staff despite challenges with recruiting clients. Both depressive symptoms and substance use were reduced by the intervention but were not significantly different from the control group.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Learning through Play Plus program (LTP Plus) - a parenting program integrated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). Methods A total of 247 women with symptoms of depression in Karachi, Pakistan were assigned randomly to either LTP Plus or routine care (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00835016). Symptoms of maternal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3 and 6 months after baseline. Results At 3 months, there was a significant reduction in the EPDS scores in the intervention group compared to the routine group (adjusted mean difference [AMD] -3.65, 95% CI -6.14 to -1.15, p < 0.004). This effect was sustained at 6 months (AMD -2.62, 95% CI -4.43 to -0.81, p < 0.005). These women also reported less parental distress and disability. There was also a significant improvement in maternal knowledge about child development at 6 months.

This article details the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-week, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral intervention offered to rural, minority, low-income women at risk for antepartum depression. Methods: A total of 146 pregnant women were stratified by high risk for antepartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score of 10 or higher) or by low-moderate risk (EPDS score of 4-9) and randomized to a cognitive-behavioral intervention or treatment as usual. Differences in mean change of EPDS and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II scores for low-moderate and high-risk women in the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment as usual for the full sample were assessed from baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2), and one-month follow-up (T3), and for African American women in the subsample. Results: Both the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment-as-usual groups had significant reductions in the EPDS scores from T1 to T2 and T1 to T3. In women at high risk for depression (n = 62), there was no significant treatment effect from T1 to T2 or T3 for the EPDS. However, in low-moderate risk women, there was a significantly greater mean change in the BDI-II scores from significant decrease in the BDI-II scores from T1 to T2 (4.92 vs 0.59, P = .018) and T1 to T3 (5.67 vs 1.51, P =04). Also, the cognitive-behavioral intervention significantly reduced EPDS scores for African American women at high risk (n = 43) from T1 to T2 (5.59 vs 2.18, P = .02) and from T1 to T3 (6.32 vs 3.14, P =04). Discussion: A cognitive-behavioral intervention integrated within prenatal clinics is feasible in this sample, although attrition rates were high. Compared to treatment as usual, the cognitive-behavioral intervention reduced depressive symptoms for African American women at high risk for antepartum depression and for the full sample of women at low-moderate risk for antepartum depression.

A survey of 4000 women within 4-6 weeks postpartum in 80 communities in Shenzhen, China was performed using random cluster sampling method. By employing Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as a screening tool, the positive women (defined as EPDS >/=10) were randomly divided into intervention group and control group at a ratio of 1:2. The women in the intervention group were treated by means of mailing postpartum depression prevention and treatment knowledge manual, face-to-face counseling, and telephone psychological counseling interventions aiming at individual risk factors, while those in the control group were treated with conventional methods. EPDS scores were assessed in these two groups again at 6th month postpartum. Totally, 3907 valid questionnaires were obtained. All the 771 positive women were divided into two groups: 257 in the intervention group, and 514 in the control group. At 6th month postpartum, the EPDS scores in the intervention group were decreased significantly, from baseline stage (12.84+/-3.02) to end stage (3.05+/-2.93), while EPDS scores in the control group were reduced from 12.44+/-2.78 to 6.94+/-4.02. There were significant differences in the EPDS scores at end stage between the two groups (t=13.059, P<0.001). Psychological intervention can reduce postpartum depression, with better maternal compliance. It is feasible and necessary to establish postpartum depression screening and psychological intervention model in community-hospital and include the postpartum depression screening, intervention, and follow-up into the conventional healthcare.";"Psychological intervention for postpartum depression";"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/352/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf?auth66=1427209479_f9b9ff03bd22c12c4794d4ed4b4074c9&ext=.pdf and http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/352/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11596-014-1297-x&token2=exp=1441969485~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F352%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x*~hmac=5dde6f51989c0bfecb8ed596598da676d2d259c9ae6f4a1a4a50878d4b7e30ed";"J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci";"Jiang, 2014";"Jiang_2014_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA_msd_epds_self-report_0_post"

Internet Interventions, 17. doi:10.1016/j.invent.2019.100247";101016;"Depression is one of the most common health problems worldwide but is often undertreated. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) appears to be an effective treatment option, with the potential to reach a larger proportion of individuals suffering from depression. While many studies have examined the efficacy of ICBT for depression in randomized controlled trials, fewer have focused on the effectiveness of ICBT when used as an integral part of routine health care. In this study the effectiveness of an 8-week ICBT program was examined when delivered in a routine psychiatric setting. A total of 108 patients were referred and 54 were then included and randomized to either ICBT or a waitlist control condition. The sample had a lower education level and a higher proportion of individuals were on sick leave than comparable previous efficacy trials of ICBT for depression conducted in Sweden. Measures assessing depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms were administered before and after treatment, follow up was performed at 6- and 12 months after treatment had ended. ICBT resulted in significant reductions of depressive symptoms in the treatment group when compared to a waitlist control group with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.6).

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) appears to be an effective treatment option, with the potential to reach a larger proportion of individuals suffering from depression. While many studies have examined the efficacy of ICBT for depression in randomized controlled trials, fewer have focused on the effectiveness of ICBT when used as an integral part of routine health care. In this study the effectiveness of an 8-week ICBT program was examined when delivered in a routine psychiatric setting. A total of 108 patients were referred and 54 were then included and randomized to either ICBT or a waitlist control condition. The sample had a lower education level and a higher proportion of individuals were on sick leave than comparable previous efficacy trials of ICBT for depression conducted in Sweden. Measures assessing depression, anxiety and psychiatric symptoms were administered before and after treatment, follow up was performed at 6- and 12 months after treatment had ended. ICBT resulted in significant reductions of depressive symptoms in the treatment group when compared to a waitlist control group with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.6). Treatment gains were maintained at 6- and 12 months after the treatment had ended. In terms of clinical significance, 58% of the sample had improved or recovered after treatment.

How effective is bibliotherapy for very old adults with subthreshold depression? A randomized controlled trial. American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 2011;19(3):256-65.";101097;"OBJECTIVES: Depressive symptoms are common among elderly primary care patients, and because they encounter considerable barriers in seeking help and they often resist referral to specialized mental health facilities, it is important to look for easily accessible interventions within the primary care setting. Bibliotherapy, which has been found to be effective among younger populations, might be an attractive option. In this study, the authors investigated the effectiveness of bibliotherapy for depressive symptomatology in very old adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. After a 3-month period of ""watchful waiting,"" the participants were randomly assigned to a bibliotherapy group or a usual care group. SETTING: Thirty-three general practices in the north-western region of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy community-dwelling adults, aged 75 and older, with subthreshold depression. INTERVENTION: The bibliotherapy intervention consisted of an information leaflet and a self-help manual ""Coping with Depression"" adapted for the elderly. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures after 3 months were a) change in depressive symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and b) the proportion of participants who scored a significant improvement on the CES-D. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six (85.9%) of the 170 participants completed the baseline and follow-up measurements. The authors did not find any clinically relevant and statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group in the severity of the depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Bibliotherapy as a stand-alone intervention for the elderly (aged 75 years and older) did not reduce depressive symptoms more than usual care. This might indicate that bibliotherapy can only be effective for patients who are motivated and acknowledge their depression.";"How effective is bibliotherapy for very old adults with subthreshold depression?

Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to mental healthcare delivered by mhGAP-trained primary care workers (psychoeducation and psychotropic medicines when indicated), or the same services plus individual psychological treatments (Healthy Activity Program for depression and Counselling for Alcohol Problems).

Clinical & experimental ophthalmology, 45(4), 371-378.";101111;"DESIGN: A single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada.PARTICIPANTS: Eighty participants were recruited.METHODS: To be eligible, participants must have had either late stage age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, at least mild depressive symptoms, and visual acuity better than 20/200. Half were randomized to the intervention arm and half to delayed intervention/usual care. The intervention consisted of large print written and audio tools incorporating cognitive-behavioral principles plus three 10-minute telephone calls from a lay coach. Eight-week follow-up data were collected by telephone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 8-week change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, life space and self-efficacy.RESULTS: The baseline mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.37 (SD=0.20), and the baseline mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score was 9.5 (SD=3.9) indicating moderate depressive symptoms. After adjusting for baseline imbalances in visual acuity, the intervention reduced depressive symptoms by 2.1 points more than usual care (P=0.040). The intervention was not associated with the secondary outcomes (P>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Self-care tools plus telephone coaching led to a modest improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with age-related eye disease. Additional research on how to maximize their effect is necessary.BACKGROUND: Depression is very common in people with age-related eye disease.

Method: Ten care teams were randomized to MI with standard management of depression (MI-SMD; 4 teams, 10 providers, 88 patients) or SMD alone (6 teams, 16 providers, 80 patients). Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 36 weeks with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Treatment receipt was ascertained through patient inquiry and electronic records. Audio-recorded index encounters were evaluated for mediators of improved depressive symptoms (providers' MI ability and patient language favoring participating in treatment or other depression related mood-improving behaviors). Results: In Intention-To-Treat analyses, MI-SMD was associated with a more favorable trajectory of PHQ-9 depressive symptom scores than SMD alone (randomization group time interaction estimate = 0.13, p = .018). At 36 weeks, MI-SMD was associated with improved depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.11, 0.72]) and remission rate (Success Rate Difference = 14.53 [1.79, 27.26]) relative to SMD alone. MI-SMD was not associated with a significant group x time interaction for remission, or with increased receipt of antidepressant medication or specialty mental health counseling. The providers' ability to direct clinical discussions toward treating depression, and the patients' language favoring engagement in mood-improving behaviors, mediated the effects of MI-SMD on depressive symptoms (ps = .05).

Effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help intervention for outpatients with a depressive disorder: Short-term results from a randomized controlled trial. Journal of medical Internet research, 18(3).";NA;"Background: Research has convincingly demonstrated that symptoms of depression can be reduced through guided Internet-based interventions. However, most of those studies recruited people form the general population. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness when delivered in routine clinical practice in outpatient clinics. Objective: The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to study patients with a depressive disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, fourth edition), as assessed by trained interviewers with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, who registered for treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of guided Internet-based self-help before starting face-to-face treatment. Methods: We recruited 269 outpatients, aged between 18 and 79 years, from outpatient clinics and randomly allocated them to Internet-based problem solving therapy (n = 136), with weekly student support, or to a control condition, who remained on the waitlist with a self-help booklet (control group; n = 133). Participants in both conditions were allowed to take up face-to-face treatment at the outpatient clinics afterward. We measured the primary outcome, depressive symptoms, by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). All outcomes were assessed by telephone at posttest (8 weeks after baseline). Results: Posttest measures were completed by 184 (68.4%) participants. We found a moderate to large within-group effect size for both the intervention (d = 0.75) and the control (d=0.69) group. However, the between-group effect size was very small (d = 0.07), and regression analysis on posttreatment CES-D scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (b = 1.134, 95% CI -2.495 to 4.763). The per-protocol analysis ( 4 sessions completed) results were also not significant (b = 1.154, 95% CI -1.978 to 7.637). Between-group differences were small and not significant for all secondary outcomes. Adherence to the intervention was low. Only 36% (49/136) received an adequate dosage of the intervention ( 4 of 5 sessions). The overall treatment satisfaction was moderate. Conclusions: Internet-based problem solving therapy is not more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than receiving an unguided self-help book during the waitlist period at outpatient mental health clinics. The effect sizes are much smaller than those found in earlier research in the general population, and the low rates of adherence indicate that the acceptability of the intervention at this stage of treatment for depressed outpatients is low. However, taking into account that there is much evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based treatments, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments in outpatient clinics as a whole.

Computerised programs have been developed to improve accessibility, but whether these interventions are responsive to individual needs is unknown. We investigated the effectiveness of CBT delivered online in real time by a therapist for patients with depression in primary care. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised controlled trial, 297 individuals with a score of 14 or more on the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and a confirmed diagnosis of depression were recruited from 55 general practices in Bristol, London, and Warwickshire, UK. Participants were randomly assigned, by a computer-generated code, to online CBT in addition to usual care (intervention; n=149) or to usual care from their general practitioner while on an 8-month waiting list for online CBT (control; n=148). Participants, researchers involved in recruitment, and therapists were masked in advance to allocation. The primary outcome was recovery from depression (BDI score <10) at 4 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 45444578. FINDINGS: 113 participants in the intervention group and 97 in the control group completed 4-month follow-up. 43 (38%) patients recovered from depression (BDI score <10) in the intervention group versus 23 (24%) in the control group at 4 months (odds ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.23-4.67; p=0.011), and 46 (42%) versus 26 (26%) at 8 months (2.07, 1.11-3.87; p=0.023). INTERPRETATION: CBT seems to be effective when delivered online in real time by a therapist, with benefits maintained over 8 months. This method of delivery could broaden access to CBT.

Health Technology Assessment. 2000;4(19):1-83.";NA;"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of usual general practitioner (GP) care compared with two types of brief psychological therapy (non-directive counselling and cognitive-behaviour therapy) in the management of depression as well as mixed anxiety and depression in the primary care setting. DESIGN: The design was principally a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, but was accompanied by two additional allocation methods allowing patient preference: the option of a specific choice of treatment (preference allocation) and the option to be randomised between the psychological therapies only. Of the 464 patients allocated to the three treatments, 197 were randomised between the three treatments, 137 chose a specific treatment, and 130 were randomised between the psychological therapies only. The patients underwent follow-up assessments at 4 and 12 months. SETTING: The study was conducted in 24 general practices in Greater Manchester and London. SUBJECTS: A total of 464 eligible patients, aged 18 years and over, were referred by 73 GPs and allocated to one of the psychological therapies or usual GP care for depressive symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions consisted of brief psychological therapy (12 sessions maximum) or usual GP care. Non-directive counselling was provided by counsellors who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Counselling. Cognitive-behaviour therapy was provided by clinical psychologists who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Usual GP care included discussions with patients and the prescription of medication, but GPs were asked to refrain from referring patients for psychological intervention for at least 4 months. Most therapy sessions took place on a weekly basis in the general practices. By the 12-month follow-up, GP care in some cases did include referral to mental healthcare specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical outcomes included depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, social function and patient satisfaction. The economic outcomes included direct and indirect costs and quality of life. Assessments were carried out at baseline during face-to-face interviews as well as at 4 and 12 months in person or by post. RESULTS: At 4 months, both psychological therapies had reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than usual GP care. Patients in the psychological therapy groups exhibited mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory that were 4-5 points lower than the mean score of patients in the usual GP care group, a difference that was also clinically significant. These differences did not generalize to other measures of outcome. There was no significant difference in outcome between the two psychological therapies when they were compared directly using all 260 patients randomised to a psychological therapy by either randomised allocation method. At 12 months, the patients in all three groups had improved to the same extent. The lack of a significant difference between the treatment groups at this point resulted from greater improvement of the patients in the GP care group between the 4- and 12-month follow-ups. At 4 months, patients in both psychological therapy groups were more satisfied with their treatment than those in the usual GP care group. However, by 12 months, patients who had received non-directive counselling were more satisfied than those in either of the other two groups. There were few differences in the baseline characteristics of patients who were randomised or expressed a treatment preference, and no differences in outcome between these patients. Similar outcomes were found for patients who chose either psychological therapy. Again, there were no significant differences between the two groups at 4 or 12 months.

Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. 2014;43(4):289-98.";101080;"Depression presents a serious condition for the individual and a major challenge to health care and society. Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) is a treatment option supported in several trials, but there is as yet a lack of effective studies of ICBT in real world primary care settings. We examined whether ICBT differed from treatment-as-usual (TAU) in reducing depressive symptoms after 3 months. TAU comprised of visits to general practitioner, registered nurse, antidepressant drugs, waiting list for, or psychotherapy, or combinations of these alternatives. Patients, aged 18 years, who tentatively met criteria for mild to moderate depression at 16 primary care centers in the south-western region of Sweden were recruited and then assessed in a diagnostic interview. A total of 90 patients were randomized to either TAU or ICBT. The ICBT treatment included interactive elements online, a workbook, a CD with mindfulness and acceptance exercises, and minimal therapist contact. The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks after which both groups were assessed. The main outcome measure was Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Additional measures were Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale self rating version (MADRS-S) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups at post treatment, neither on BDI-II, MADRS-S, nor BAI. Twenty patients (56%) in the ICBT treatment completed all seven modules. Our findings suggest that ICBT may be successfully delivered in primary care and that the effectiveness, after 3 months, is at par with TAU.

Meta-analytic evidence suggests that they should be delivered with human support to reach optimal effects. These findings have not consistently been replicated in direct comparisons of supported and unsupported interventions, however. This study examined the role of support in Internet-based problem solving treatment (PST) for symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Adults with mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety and/or depression were recruited from the general population and randomized to: (1) PST without support (n = 107), (2) PST with support on request (n = 108), (3) PST with weekly support (n = 106), (4) no Internet-based intervention but non-specific chat or email (n = 110), or (5) waitlist control (WLC; n = 106). Primary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety (HADS) and depression (CES-D) measured at baseline and 6 weeks later.

Low self-esteem is a symptom of depressive disorders and is considered by some to be a predictor for relapse, whereas high self-esteem seems to buffer against depression. Recently, Competitive Memory Training (COMET) has shown to be effective for the enhancement of self-esteem in several psychopathological conditions. The current study assesses whether COMET is also an effective intervention for patients with depressive disorders. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with depressive disorders who were already in therapy in an outpatient mental health institution were randomly assigned to either eight group sessions of COMET in addition to their regular therapy (COMET + therapy as usual [TAU]: the experimental group) or to 8 weeks of ongoing regular therapy (TAU only: the control group). These latter (control) patients received COMET after their TAU only period. All patients in both groups that completed COMET were contacted 3 and 6 months later to assess whether the effects of COMET had remained stable. RESULTS: Compared to the patients who received TAU only, patients in the COMET + TAU condition showed significant improvement with large effect sizes on indices of self-esteem, depression, and depressive rumination. The therapeutic effects of COMET + TAU remained stable after 3 and 6 months on all outcome measures or improved even further. CONCLUSION: COMET for low self-esteem seems to be an efficacious trans-diagnostic intervention that can relatively easily be added to the regular treatment of patients with depressive disorders.";"Competitive memory training (COMET) for treating low self-esteem in patients with depressive disorders: a randomized clinical trial";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/da.20921/asset/da20921.pdf?v=1&t=iefizxd2&s=b88099af5482dc5daaf0f58403822668d40a2c08";"Depress Anxiety";"Korrelboom, 2012";"Korrelboom_2012_otherpsy_wl_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

Although there is substantial evidence for the efficacy of life review therapy as an early treatment of depression in later life, its effectiveness in natural settings has not been studied. The present study evaluates an intervention based on life review and narrative therapy in a large multi-site, pragmatic randomized controlled trial(RCT). METHOD. Life review therapy was compared with care as usual. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms;secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, positive mental health, quality of life, and current major depressive episode (MDE). To identify groups for whom the intervention was particularly effective, moderator analyses were carried out (on sociodemographic variables, personality traits, reminiscence functions, clinically relevant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and past MDEs). RESULTS. Compared with care as usual (n=102), life review therapy (n=100) was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, at post-treatment (d=0.60, B= -5.3, p<0.001), at 3-month follow-up (d=0.50, B= -5.0, p<0.001) and for the intervention also at 9-month follow-up (t=5.7, p<0.001). The likelihood of a clinically significant change in depressive symptoms was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) 3.77, p<0.001 at post-treatment ; OR 3.76, p<0.001 at the 3-month follow-up]. Small significant effects were found for symptoms of anxiety and positive mental health.Moderator analyses showed only two significant moderators, the personality trait of extraversion and the reminiscence function of boredom reduction. CONCLUSIONS. This study shows the effectiveness of life review therapy as an early intervention for depression in an ecologically valid context, supporting its applicability to a broad target group. The intervention is also effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and strengthening positive mental health.";"Life review therapy for older adults with moderate depressive symptomatology: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/790/CN-00971790/frame.html and http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSM%2FPSM42_06%2FS0033291711002042a.pdf&code=05eaf0d70e2d1087589a28152cc6112a";"Psychological medicine";"Korte, 2012";"Korte_2012_lrt_wl_NA_NA_msd_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

The Depression in Elderly with Long-Term Afflictions (DELTA) study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention (MPI) in chronically ill elderly persons with depression. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing the MPI with usual care in 361 primary care patients. Four nurses had an average of 4 sessions with the intervention patients, each lasting 1 h, over a maximum period of 3 months. Patients were aged 60 years and older, had a minor depression or mild-to-moderate major depression, and either had type II diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Nine months after the intervention, patients receiving the MPI had significantly fewer depressive symptoms; the intervention patients were also more likely than usual-care controls to show a >or=50% reduction in depressive symptoms relative to baseline values. At 9 months, diabetic MPI patients had a better quality of life than diabetic controls. CONCLUSIONS: The nurse-led MPI appears to be a feasible and moderately effective method of managing minor-to-moderate depression in chronically ill elderly persons. However, we cannot rule out attention-placebo effects, and the disappointing finding of a recent economic evaluation showing only a 63% chance of the MPI being cost-effective. From a clinical point of view, however, it is of interest to further evaluate adaptations of the MPI, with a stronger emphasis on detection, watchful waiting and mental health problems in general.";"A minimal psychological intervention in chronically ill elderly patients with depression: a randomized trial";NA;"Psychother Psychosom";"Lamers, 2010";"Lamers_2010_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

We evaluated ego-integrity and rumination as mediators and assessed whether the effects of the intervention did not differ across middle-aged and older adults. Method: Effects of life-review (n = 58) were compared with a waiting list group (n = 58) and an expressive writing intervention (n = 58) on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, and well-being (secondary outcomes). Mediator and moderator analyses were also applied. Results: Compared with the waiting list, life-review reduced depressive symptoms (d = 0.35) and enhanced emotional (d = 0.16) and psychological well-being (d = 0.27). Life-review was not more effective than expressive writing. The effects on depressive symptoms were partly related with increases in ego-integrity and decreases in rumination. The intervention is applicable for middle-aged and older adults. Conclusion: Life-review is effective as self-help for middle-aged and older adults with moderate depressive symptomatology compared with a waiting list group. Future research should investigate whether stimulating ego-integrity and reducing rumination enhance the effects of the intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Participants were evaluated with standardized self-reporting measures (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI-II], Symptom Checklist90 [SCL-90], Acceptance and Action Questionnaire [AAQ-2], Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ], Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire [ATQ], and White Bear Suppression Inventory [WBSI]) at pre- and post-measurement. Long-term effects in the iACT group were examined using a 12-month follow-up. The iACT program comprised home assignments, online feedback given by masters-level students of psychology over a 7-week intervention period, and automated email-based reminders. Significant effects were observed in favor of the iACT group on depression symptomatology (between effect sizes [ESs] at post-treatment, iACT/WLC, g = .83), psychological and physiological symptoms (g = .60), psychological flexibility (g = .67), mindfulness skills (g = .53), and frequency of automatic thoughts (g = .57) as well as thought suppression (g = .53). The treatment effects in the iACT group were maintained over the 12-month follow-up period (within-iACT ES: BDI-II, g = 1.33; SCL-90, g = 1.04; ATQF/B [Frequency/Believability], FFMQ, WBSI, AAQ-II, g = .74-1.08). The iACT participants stated that they would be happy to recommend the same intervention to others with depressive symptoms. We conclude that an ACT-based guided Internet-delivered treatment with minimal contact can be effective for people with depressive symptoms.

Journal of Affective Disorders, 210, 151-157.";101016;"Background Depression is common in low-income pregnant women, and treatments need to be fitted to meet their needs. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing brief Interpersonal Psychotherapy (brief-IPT) to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) for perinatal depression in low-income women. The brief-IPT model is designed to better engage low-income women by utilizing an engagement session, providing flexible delivery of sessions, and pragmatic case management. Methods Pregnant women, aged >18, between 12 and 30 weeks gestation were recruited from an urban prenatal clinic. Women scoring >10 on the Edinburgh Depression Scale and meeting depressive disorder criteria were randomized to either brief-IPT (n=21) or ETAU (n=21). We assessed treatment outcomes, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention (measured by session attendance). Results Depression scores significantly decreased in both brief-IPT and ETAU. Brief-IPT participants reported significant improvements in social support satisfaction as compared to ETAU participants, even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Brief-IPT participants reported high satisfaction with the program. However, many participants did not participate in the full 9-session course of treatment (average sessions attended =6, range 0-17). Limitations Small sample size, use of self-report measures, and lack of an active psychotherapy control group limits interpretation of study results. Conclusions Brief-IPT for perinatal depression is acceptable to low-income women and is helpful for improving depressive symptoms and social support. However, feasibility of the treatment was limited by relatively low session attendance in spite of efforts to maximize treatment engagement. Additional modifications to meet the needs of low-income women are discussed.

Journal of Affective Disorders. 2020;271:286-292.";101016;"Background


Perinatal depression is a public health burden impacting mothers and their offspring. This study extended brief-Interpersonal Psychotherapy delivered during pregnancy by incorporating a postpartum attachment based dyadic-component to maintain mother's treatment gains and enhance the mother-infant relationship (called IPT-Dyad). The current report presents data from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing IPT-Dyad to Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU).





Methods


Women, ages 18 and older, between 12â€“30 weeks gestation meeting criteria for a depressive disorder were eligible. Participants were randomized to either IPT-Dyad (n = 21) or ETAU (n = 21). Maternal and infant outcomes were assessed through one-year postpartum.





Results


Participants were primarily African American (77%), single (80%), with low-incomes. Attrition was high in both groups (IPT-Dyad 30%; ETAU 40%). Depression scores improved from baseline in both groups and remained improved over the 12 month follow-up. There were no between group differences on measures of parenting stress, mother-infant interactions, and infant socioemotional functioning.





Limitations


The small sample size of this study was further reduced by attrition, despite efforts to maintain engagement. Reliance on self-report outcome measures is also a limitation.





Conclusions


IPT-Dyad may be a promising intervention for perinatal depression with potential benefit for mothers and babies. Treatment engagement and management of psychosocial needs were persistent challenges throughout the postpartum period. Further refinement of intervention content and schedule to better meet the needs and values of under-resourced mothers is needed. Earlier screening; better integration of care within OB settings; and delivering care in conjunction with social service resources may also improve outcomes.";NA;NA;NA;"Lenze, 2020";"Lenze_2020_ipt_cau_NA_NA_msd_epds_self-report_0_post"

Methods: A randomized clinical trial allocated an initial sample of 431 eligible employed adults (age 45) to a work-focused intervention (WFI) or usual care. Inclusion criteria were depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and at-work limitations indicated by a productivity loss score 5% on the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ). Study sites included 19 employers and five related organizations. Telephone-based counseling provided three integrated modalities: care coordination, cognitive-behavioral therapy strategy development, and work coaching and modification. Effectiveness (change in productivity loss scores from preintervention to four months postintervention) was tested with mixed models adjusted for confounders. Secondary outcomes included change in WLQ work performance scales, self-reported absences, and depression. Results: Of 1,227 eligible employees (7% of screened), 431 (35%) enrolled and 380 completed the study (12% attrition). At-work productivity loss improved 44% in the WFI group versus 13% in usual care (difference in change, p<.001). WFI group scores on the four WLQ scales improved 44% to 47%, significantly better than in usual care (p<.001 for each scale). Absence days declined by 53% in the WFI group versus 13% in usual care (difference in change, p<.001). Mean PHQ-9 depression symptom severity scores declined 51% for WFI versus 26% for usual care (difference in change, p<.001). Conclusions: The WFI was more effective than usual care at four-month follow-up. Given increasing efforts to provide more patient-centered, value-based care, the WFI could be an important resource.";"A randomized clinical trial of a telephone depression intervention to reduce employee presenteeism and absenteeism";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L604840621 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.201400350 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=15579700&id=doi:10.1176%2Fappi.ps.201400350&atitle=A+randomized+clinical+trial+of+a+telephone+depression+intervention+to+reduce+employee+presenteeism+and+absenteeism&stitle=Psychiatr.+Serv.&title=Psychiatric+Services&volume=66&issue=6&spage=570&epage=577&aulast=Lerner&aufirst=Debra&auinit=D.&aufull=Lerner+D.&coden=PSSEF&isbn=&pages=570-577&date=2015&auinit1=D&auinitm= and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4451283/pdf/nihms-679945.pdf";"Psychiatric Services";"Lerner, 2015";"Lerner_2015_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_phq-9_self-report_0_post"

METHODS: Two hundred three (203) women were randomized to behavioral weight loss (n = 102) or behavioral weight loss combined with cognitive-behavioral depression management (n = 101). RESULTS: Average participant age was 52 years; mean baseline body mass index was 39 kg/m(2). Mean Patient Health Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) scores indicated moderate to severe baseline depression. Weight loss and SCL-20 changes did not differ between groups at 6 or 12 months in intent-to-treat analyses (p = 0.26 and 0.55 for weight, p = 0.70 and 0.25 for depressive symptoms).

Adults with depressive symptoms (N = 52, M age = 26.4) were randomly assigned to the treatment condition or the delayed treatment control condition. Participants were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results indicated that participants overall depression level lowered at posttreatment. Analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat basis. Multiple imputation inference procedure (Rubin in Multiple imputation for non response in surveys, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York 1987) was adopted to estimate missing values and to draw inferences based on the imputed data. Results of the analyses indicated that the cognitive-affective symptoms of depression, rather than the somatic symptoms of depression, evidenced significant reduction as a result of cognitive bibliotherapy. Further reductions in cognitive affective symptoms were observed at 3-month follow-up. Lastly, learned resourcefulness was found to be a mechanism through which bibliotherapy reduced depressive symptoms. The present study provides preliminary evidence that cognitive bibliotherapy may be a promising treatment option for Chinese individuals with depressive symptoms. In the meantime, participants qualitative feedback may provide important direction for cross cultural adaptation of cognitive bibliotherapy. Applied implications and cultural issues are discussed.

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. 2015;83(4):760-72.";101037;"Objective: The differential efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) for dementia family caregivers is analyzed through a randomized controlled trial. Method: Participants were 135 caregivers with high depressive symptomatology who were randomly allocated to the intervention conditions or a control group (CG). Pre-, postintervention, and follow-up measurements assessed depressive symptomatology, anxiety, leisure, dysfunctional thoughts, and experiential avoidance. Results: Depression: Significant effects of interventions compared with CG were found for CBT (p < .001, d = 0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 3.61) and ACT (p < .001, d = 1.17, NNT = 3.53) at postintervention, but were maintained only at follow-up for CBT (p = .02, d = 0.74, NNT = 9.71). Clinically significant change was observed in 26.7% participants in CBT, 24.2% in ACT, and 0% in CG. At follow-up, 10.53% in CBT and 4% in ACT were recovered (0% CG). Anxiety: At postintervention, ACT participants showed lower anxiety than CBT participants (p < .05, d = 0.50) and CG participants (p < .01, d = 0.79, NNT = 3.86), with no effects at follow-up. At postintervention, 23.33% in CBT, 36.36% in ACT, and 6.45% in CG showed clinically significant change. At follow-up, 26.32% in CBT, 36% in ACT, and 13.64% in CG were recovered.

Method: Participants were 135 caregivers with high depressive symptomatology who were randomly allocated to the intervention conditions or a control group (CG). Pre-, postintervention, and follow-up measurements assessed depressive symptomatology, anxiety, leisure, dysfunctional thoughts, and experiential avoidance. Results: Depression: Significant effects of interventions compared with CG were found for CBT (p < .001, d = 0.98, number needed to treat [NNT] = 3.61) and ACT (p < .001, d = 1.17, NNT = 3.53) at postintervention, but were maintained only at follow-up for CBT (p = .02, d = 0.74, NNT = 9.71). Clinically significant change was observed in 26.7% participants in CBT, 24.2% in ACT, and 0% in CG. At follow-up, 10.53% in CBT and 4% in ACT were recovered (0% CG). Anxiety: At postintervention, ACT participants showed lower anxiety than CBT participants (p < .05, d = 0.50) and CG participants (p < .01, d = 0.79, NNT = 3.86), with no effects at follow-up. At postintervention, 23.33% in CBT, 36.36% in ACT, and 6.45% in CG showed clinically significant change. At follow-up, 26.32% in CBT, 36% in ACT, and 13.64% in CG were recovered.

Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2016;18(8):e194.";NA;"Background: Depressive symptoms, and the associated coexistence of symptoms of anxiety and decreased quality of life (QoL), are a common problem in patients with heart failure (HF). However, treatment strategies for depressive symptoms in patients with HF still remain to be established. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and its Internet-based version as guided self-help CBT programs (ICBT) have shown good effects in the treatment of depression, but ICBT has not previously been evaluated in patients with HF and depressive symptoms. Objective: The aims of this study were to: (I) evaluate the effect of a nine-week ICBT program on depressive symptoms in patients with HF; (II) to assess factors associated with the change in depressive symptoms; and (III) to investigate the effect of the ICBT program on cardiac anxiety and QoL. Methods: Fifty participants were included and randomized into two treatment arms: ICBT or an online moderated discussion forum (DF). The Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depressive symptoms, the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ) was used to measure cardiac-related anxiety, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHF) was used to measure QoL. Data were collected at baseline and at the nine-week follow-up. Results: In the ICBT group, depressive symptoms (M=10.8 vs. M=8.6, P=.02) and cardiac anxiety in the subscale of fear (M=1.55 vs. M=1.35, P=.04) improved significantly. QoL improved in the ICBT group by 6 points in the total score and 2.4 points in the physical factor, but this was not significant (P=.09 and P=.12). In the DF group, only a small reduction in the level of depressive symptoms was detected (M =10.6 SD=5.0, vs. M=9.8 SD=4.3, P=.36). Despite improvement in the ICBT group this was not significantly different compared to the DF group (ANCOVA analyses: depressive symptoms, P=.21; cardiac-related anxiety subscale of fear, P=.22; QoL total scale score, P=.09 and physical factors, P=.07). In the ICBT group, the number of logins to the web-portal correlated significantly with improvement in depressive symptoms (P=.02), whereas higher age (P=.01) and male sex (P=.048) were associated with less change in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Guided ICBT adapted for persons with HF and depressive symptoms can potentially reduce depressive symptoms, cardiac anxiety and increased QoL, but is not statistically superior to participation in an online discussion forum.";"The effect of guided web-based cognitive behavioral therapy on patients with depressive symptoms and heart failure-a randomized controlled trial";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72307156 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.539 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=18790844&id=doi:10.1002%2Fejhf.539&atitle=The+effect+of+guided+web-based+cognitive+behavioral+therapy+on+patients+with+depressive+symptoms+and+heart+failure-a+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Eur.+J.+Heart+Fail.&title=European+Journal+of+Heart+Failure&volume=18&issue=&spage=401&epage=&aulast=Johan+Lundgren&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Johan+Lundgren+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=401-&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=";"European Journal of Heart Failure";"Lundgren, 2016";"Lundgren_2016_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA_msd_phq-9_self-report_0_post"

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Referral-based academic medical center. PATIENTS: 51 patients with type 2 diabetes and major depression. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned either to a group that received 10 weeks of individual CBT or to a control group that received no specific antidepressant treatment. All patients participated in a diabetes education program to control for the effects of supportive attention and the possible influence of enhanced diabetes control on mood. MEASUREMENTS: Degree of depression was measured by using the Beck Depression Inventory; glycemic control was measured by using glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Outcomes were assessed immediately after treatment and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: The percentage of patients achieving remission of depression (Beck Depression Inventory score < or = 9) was greater in the CBT group than in the control group: posttreatment, 85.0% of patients in the CBT group (17 of 20) compared with 27.3% of controls (6 of 22) achieved remission (difference, 57.7 percentage points [95% CI, 33 to 82 percentage points]) (P < 0.001); at follow-up, 70.0% of patients in the CBT group (14 of 20) compared with 33.3% of controls (7 of 21) achieved remission (difference, 36.7 percentage points [CI, 9 to 65 percentage points]) (P = 0.03). Post-treatment glycosylated hemoglobin levels were not different in the two groups, but follow-up mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels were significantly better in the CBT group than in the control group (9.5% compared with 10.9%; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CBT and supportive diabetes education is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment for major depression in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Referrals to mental health professionals are frequently resisted by patients. The need for more effective treatment strategies led to the development and evaluation of a telephone-based, problem-solving intervention. METHODS: Patients in a family practice residency practice were evaluated through the Medical Outcomes Study Depression Screening Scale and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule to identify those with subthreshold or minor depression. Twenty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to either a treatment or comparison group. Initial scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were equivalent for the groups and were in the mildly depressed range. Six problem-solving therapy sessions were conducted over the telephone by graduate student therapists supervised by a psychiatrist. RESULTS: Treatment group subjects had significantly lower post-intervention scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale compared with their pre-intervention scores (P < .05). Scores did not differ significantly over time in the comparison group. Post-intervention, treatment group subjects also had lower Beck Depression Inventory scores than did the comparison group (P < .02), as well as more positive scores for social health (P < .002), mental health (P < .05), and self-esteem (P < .05) on the Duke Health Profile. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that brief, telephone-based treatment for minor depression in family practice settings may be an efficient and effective method to decrease symptoms of depression and improve functioning. Nurses in these settings with appropriate training and supervision may also be able to provide this treatment.";"Telephone counseling for patients with minor depression: preliminary findings in a family practice setting";NA;"J Fam Pract";"Lynch, 1997";"Lynch_1997_pst_cau_NA_NA_otherstatistic_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

Coach-facilitated web-based therapy compared with information about web-based resources in patients referred to secondary mental health care for depression: Randomized controlled trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2020;22(6).";102196;"Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with a high social burden and significant impact on suicidality and quality of life. Treatment is often limited to drug therapies because of long waiting times to see psychological therapists face to face, despite several guidelines recommending that psychological treatments should be first-line interventions for mild to moderate depression.


Objective: We aimed to evaluate, among patients on a waitlist to receive secondary mental health care services for depression, how effective coach-guided web-based therapy (The Journal) is, compared with an information-only waitlist control group, in reducing depression symptoms after 12 weeks.


Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms and a process evaluation, which included interviews with study participants. Participants assigned to the intervention group received 12 weeks of web-based therapy guided by a coach who had a background in social work. Patients in the control group receive a leaflet of mental health resources they could access. The primary outcome measure was a change in depression scores, as measured by the Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).


Results: A total of 95 participants were enrolled (intervention, n=47; control, n=48). The mean change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to week 12 was âˆ’3.6 (SD 6.6) in the intervention group and âˆ’3.1 (SD 6.2) in the control group, which was not a statistically significant difference with a two-sided alpha of .05 (t91=âˆ’0.37; P=.72, 95% CI âˆ’3.1 to 2.2). At 12 weeks, participants in the intervention group reported higher health-related quality of life (mean EuroQol 5 dimensions visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-VAS] score 66.8, SD 18.0) compared with the control group (mean EQ-5D VAS score 55.9, SD 19.2; t84=âˆ’2.73; P=.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in health service use following their initial consultation with a psychiatrist. The process evaluation showed that participants in the intervention group completed a mean of 5.0 (SD 2.3) lessons in The Journal and 8.8 (SD 3.1) sessions with the coach. Most participants (29/47, 62%) in the intervention group who completed the full dose of the intervention, by finishing 6 or more lessons in The Journal, were more likely to have a clinically important reduction in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks compared with the control group (Î§21=6.3; P=.01, Î¦=0.37). Participants who completed the interviews reported that the role played by the coach was a major factor in adherence to the study intervention. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the use of guided web-based therapy for the treatment of depression is not more effective than information-only waitlist control. However, it showed that the coach has the potential to increase adherence and engagement with web-based depression treatment protocols. Further research is needed on what makes the coach effective.";NA;NA;NA;"MacLean, 2020";"MacLean_2020_otherpsy_otherctr_NA_NA_msd_phq-9_self-report_0_post"

Randomized controlled trial comparing brief dynamic and supportive therapy with waiting list condition in minor depressive disorders. Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics. 2005;74(1):43-50.";101159;"BACKGROUND: Although many evidences suggest the presence of specific therapeutic factors in brief dynamic therapy (BDT), few studies have investigated its efficacy in the treatment of depressive disorders in comparison to other psychotherapies. The aim of this study was to determine whether BDT is more effective than brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP) and waiting list condition in the treatment of minor depressive disorders. METHOD: Thirty patients with primary DSM-IV dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified or adjustment disorder with depressed mood completed a randomized controlled trial with three treatment groups (BDT, BSP, waiting list condition). A 6-month follow-up was performed for patients treated with both psychotherapeutic approaches. Other psychiatric treatments were not permitted throughout the treatment period and the 6-month follow-up. Symptoms were assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and after 6 months of follow-up.

The aim of this study was to determine whether BDT is more effective than brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP) and waiting list condition in the treatment of minor depressive disorders. METHOD: Thirty patients with primary DSM-IV dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified or adjustment disorder with depressed mood completed a randomized controlled trial with three treatment groups (BDT, BSP, waiting list condition). A 6-month follow-up was performed for patients treated with both psychotherapeutic approaches. Other psychiatric treatments were not permitted throughout the treatment period and the 6-month follow-up. Symptoms were assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and after 6 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Patients treated with both psychotherapeutic approaches showed a significant improvement after treatment in comparison to non-treated controls, but BDT was more effective at follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: BDT is a promising treatment for minor depressive disorders. This study also suggests that BDT is more effective than supportive psychotherapy in improving the long-term outcome of depressive disorders.";"Randomized controlled trial comparing brief dynamic and supportive therapy with waiting list condition in minor depressive disorders";"http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/82026";"Psychother Psychosom";"Maina, 2005";"Maina_2005_dyn_wl_dyn(dynamictherapy)_wl_msd_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

This study aims to examine the a new model for depression care in a low-resource environment compared to enhanced treatment at usual (E-TAU). Methods: We trained non-specialist community health workers (local lay employees of the public health system) to provide Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat depressive symptoms in the Brazilian, Sao Paulo city, family health strategy (FHS). We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 86 patients with a current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (based on DSM-IV) recruited from an FHS clinic. Participants were randomized to IPC intervention (n=43) or E-TAU (n=43). Participants allocated to IPC received 3-4 sessions provided by community health workers; research psychologists followed the E-TAU participants to facilitate their referral to specialized mental health care within the public system. Reduction of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); minor psychiatric symptomatology (including depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms) were measured using the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ); and functioning was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale over a 2-month period. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant improvement on symptoms for both groups over 2months, without significant differences between them. Per-protocol analysis showed significant better HDRS-17 outcomes for the IPC group. Conclusions: Training non-specialist community health workers in low- and middle-income countries to provide IPC could be a successful strategy in reducing the burden of depression and also potentially a low-cost and effective alternative to specialist-led services that might not be possible in low income settings.

Very limited research has assessed the efficacy of evidence-based interventions for MDD in college students. Mindfulness-Based Therapy (MBT) and Behavioral Activation (BA) are two interventions with significant potential to meet demands of college counseling clinics and effectively treat college students with MDD. This study utilized a randomized controlled research design (n = 50) to examine the efficacy of four-sessions of abbreviated MBT and BA relative to a wait-list control condition with depressed college students. Intent-to-treat data analyses on depression outcome measures suggested both treatments were superior to the control group. There were significant pre-post treatment improvements across measures of depression, rumination, stress, and mindfulness, gains largely maintained at 1-month follow-up. Neither active treatment effectively reduced somatic anxiety. Both treatments generally had moderate-strong effect sizes relative to the control group, and based on depression response and remission criteria, 56-79% of patients exhibited clinically significant improvement. Based on reliable change indices, 75-85% experienced clinically significant reductions in depression.

Despite this, there is a paucity of research on intervention programmes designed to address depression and anxiety, and none that include infant outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief treatment for maternal depression and anxiety in pregnancy in a sample of women with a diagnosed depressive disorder. We developed a cognitive behavioural therapy treatment for antenatal depression and anxiety and evaluated it in a feasibility trial. This was followed by a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) which collected data on the efficacy of the brief intervention and follow-up data on infants. The feasibility study (n = 25) yielded promising results for adherence, acceptability and improvements in depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory). The RCT (n = 54) again showed excellent adherence and acceptability and supported the efficacy of the treatment. Strong reductions in anxiety were observed during pregnancy, and improvements in depression were maintained at 9 months representing a moderately large effect size. Nine-month infant outcomes showed several medium to large effects favouring the intervention in domains including problem solving, self-regulation and stress reactivity, which were independent of maternal postnatal mood. Treating severe depression and anxiety during pregnancy with a brief cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention appears feasible and worthwhile. To reliably detect clinically meaningful effects on infant outcomes, larger RCTs are likely to be required.";"Feasibility study and pilot randomised trial of an antenatal depression treatment with infant follow-up";"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/53/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00737-015-0512-5.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00737-015-0512-5&token2=exp=1452255700~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F53%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00737-015-0512-5.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00737-015-0512-5*~hmac=6090118701555c041f761df21db33dc11df030c8d04e12c525b869f0a5737056";"Arch Womens Ment Health";"Milgrom, 2015b";"Milgrom_2015b_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

Internet cognitive behavioral therapy for women with postnatal depression: A randomized controlled trial of MumMoodBooster. Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2016;18(3):e54.";102196;"BACKGROUND: There are few published controlled trials examining the efficacy of Internet-based treatment for postnatal depression (PND) and none that assess diagnostic status (clinical remission) as the primary outcome. This is despite the need to improve treatment uptake and accessibility because fewer than 50% of postnatally depressed women seek help, even when identified as depressed. OBJECTIVE: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to test the efficacy of a 6-session Internet intervention (the MumMoodBooster program, previously evaluated in a feasibility trial) in a sample of postnatal women with a clinical diagnosis of depression. The MumMoodBooster program is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, is highly interactive, includes a partner website, and was supported by low-intensity telephone coaching. METHODS: This was a parallel 2-group RCT (N=43) comparing the Internet CBT treatment (n=21) to treatment as usual (n=22). At baseline and at 12 weeks after enrollment, women's diagnostic status was assessed by telephone with the Standardized Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) and symptom severity with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Depression symptoms were measured repeatedly throughout the study period with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: At the end of the study, 79% (15/19) of women who received the Internet CBT treatment no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression on the SCID-IV (these outcome data were missing for 2 intervention participants). This contrasted with only 18% (4/22) remission in the treatment as usual condition. Depression scores on the BDI-II showed a large effect favoring the intervention group (d=.83, 95% CI 0.20-1.45). Small to medium effects were found on the PHQ-9 and on measures of anxiety and stress. Adherence to the program was very good with 86% (18/21) of users completing all sessions; satisfaction with the program was rated 3.1 out of 4 on average. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that our Internet CBT program, MumMoodBooster, is an effective treatment option for women clinically diagnosed with PND. This is one of only two controlled evaluations of specialized online psychological treatment among women clinically diagnosed with PND. MumMoodBooster appears to be a feasible, effective treatment option, which is potentially accessible to large numbers of women in metropolitan, rural, and remote areas. Future work might be focused profitably on establishing comparability with face-to-face treatments and purely self-guided delivery. We have commenced a larger RCT comparing MumMoodBooster with face-to-face CBT.

Patients were interviewed at baseline and at 12 weeks by a blind and independent clinical evaluator to assess their symptom level and social functioning. IPT-T as compared to no treatment was significantly better in lowering symptoms of depression as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (p<.02), improving global functioning (GAS) (p<.02), and improving work and social functioning (p<.03-.05, respectively).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled trial conducted in the Washington, DC, suburban area from March 1997 through May 2002 of 267 women with current major depression, who attended county-run Women, Infants, and Children food subsidy programs and Title X family planning clinics. Outcomes Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measured monthly from baseline through 6 months; instrumental role functioning (Social Adjustment Scale) and social functioning (Short Form 36-Item Health Survey) measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to an antidepressant medication intervention (trial of paroxetine switched to buproprion, if lack of response) (n = 88), a psychotherapy intervention (8 weeks of manual-guided cognitive behavior therapy) (n = 90), or referral to community mental health services (n = 89). RESULTS: Both the medication intervention (P<.001) and the psychotherapy intervention (P =.006) reduced depressive symptoms more than the community referral did. The medication intervention also resulted in improved instrumental role (P =.006) and social (P =.001) functioning. The psychotherapy intervention resulted in improved social functioning (P =.02). Women randomly assigned to receive medications were twice as likely (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-4.27; P =.057) to achieve a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 7 or less by month 6 as were those referred to community care. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-concordant care for major depression is effective for these ethnically diverse and impoverished patients. More women engaged in a sufficient duration of treatment with medications compared with psychotherapy, and outcome gains were more extensive and robust for medications.";"Treating depression in predominantly low-income young minority women: a randomized controlled trial";"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4886/JOC30289.pdf";"Jama";"Miranda, 2003";"Miranda_2003_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

Thirty-two patients with MS, who scored at least 15 on the Profile of Mood States Depression-Dejection scale, were randomly assigned to either the telephone CMS or to a usual-care control (UCC) condition. Depressive symptomatology decreased significantly in the CMS condition compared with the UCC condition. Furthermore, adherence to interferon beta-1a, a disease-modifying medication for the treatment of MS, was significantly better at the 4-month follow-up among patients who received CMS as compared with those in the UCC condition.";"Telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for the treatment of depressive symptoms in multiple sclerosis";"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/ccp/68/2/356/";"J Consult Clin Psychol";"Mohr, 2000";"Mohr_2000_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_poms-d_self-report_0_post"

However, there is no accepted definition or clear-cut treatment for subthreshold depression. Cognitive bibliotherapy is a promising approach, but further research is necessary in order to assess its clinical efficacy and key mechanisms of change. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of bibliotherapy for subthreshold depression and test whether maladaptive cognitions mediate the effects of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms. METHOD: A total of 96 young adults with subthreshold depression were randomized in one of the following treatment conditions: immediate treatment, delayed treatment, placebo and no treatment. The main outcome was represented by depressive symptoms assessed before, during and immediately after the treatment, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Automatic thoughts, dysfunctional attitudes and irrational beliefs were also assessed throughout the study, and we investigated their involvement as mediators of bibliotherapy effects on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The results indicated that cognitive bibliotherapy resulted in statistically and clinically significant changes both in depressive symptoms and cognitions, which were maintained at follow-up. In contrast, placebo was only associated with a temporary decrease in depressive symptoms, without significant cognitive changes. No changes in symptoms or cognitions were found in the delayed treatment and no treatment groups. We also found that automatic thoughts significantly mediated the effect of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study provided compelling evidence for the efficacy of cognitive bibliotherapy in subthreshold depression and showed that changes in automatic thoughts mediated the effect of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms.

Effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention, interpersonal counseling, for subdysthymic depression in medically ill elderly. The journals of gerontology Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences. 1996;51(4):M172-8.";NA;"BACKGROUND: Subdysthymic depression occurs in 20-50% of hospitalized elderly and is associated with physical and social disability, delayed recovery, and excess health service use. Despite this, little is known regarding the nature of such depressive symptomatology, or its responsivity to treatment. To address this, a randomized clinical trial assessing the feasibility and efficacy of Interpersonal Counseling (IPC), a short-term psychotherapy, was conducted. METHODS: Patients 60+ with a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score > 10 not meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression or dysthymia were recruited from the acute hospital. Thirty-five individuals were randomized to IPC and 41 to usual care (UC). IPC was delivered following hospital discharge by psychiatric clinical nurse specialists. Interviews were conducted at recruitment and 3, 6, and 12 months later. Primary outcomes were GDS scores, health ratings, and measures of physical and social functioning. RESULTS: At 3 months, IPC group members showed greater improvement than UC members on all outcome variables; between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. At 6 months, a statistically significant difference in the rate of improvement in GDS, indicated by scores of 10 or less, was observed for IPC compared to UC members (60.6% vs 35.1%). Multivariate analyses confirmed a positive treatment effect on depressive symptoms. Similar multivariate analyses showed a statistically significant positive treatment effect on self-rated health but not on physical or social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: IPC appears feasible, acceptable, and effective in short-term depressive symptom reduction and in improvement in self-rated health. Implementation of IPC interventions for subdysthymic hospitalized elderly is recommended.";"Effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention, interpersonal counseling, for subdysthymic depression in medically ill elderly";NA;"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci";"Mossey, 1996";"Mossey_1996_ipt_cau_NA_NA_remission(cut-off)_gds_self-report_0_post"

Methods: This was an assessor-blinded, randomised controlled clinical trial. Particpants with a diagnosis of depression, attending psychiatry departments of three teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, were included in the study. We screened a total of 280 patients and randomly allocated 137 of them to CaCBT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) [Treatment group] or to TAU alone [Control group]. Assessments were completed at baseline, at 3 months and at 9 months after baseline. Reduction in depression score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Depression Subscale) at 3 months was primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures included anxiety scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Anxiety Subscale), somatic symptoms (Bradford Somatic Inventory), disability (Brief Disability Questionnaire) and satisfaction with the treatment. Findings: A total of 69 participants were randomised to Treatment group and 68 to Control group. Participants in Treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in depression (p=0.000), anxiety (p=0.000), somatic symptoms (p=0.005) and disability (p=0.000). This effect was sustained at 9 months after baseline (Except for disability). Participants in Treatment group also reported higher satisfaction with treatment compared with those in Control group.

Journal of clinical psychiatry, 78(8), 1126-1135";104088;"Objective: Antidepressant medication is efficacious in the treatment of depression, but not all patients improve with antidepressant medication alone. Despite this treatment gap, limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of supplementing psychotherapy for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression is available. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of supplementing usual medication management (treatment as usual [TAU]) with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression seeking psychiatric specialty care. Methods: A 16-week assessor-masked randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up was conducted in 1 university hospital and 1 psychiatric hospital from September 2008 to December 2014. Outpatients aged 20-65 years with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression (taking antidepressant medications for 8 weeks, 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [GRID-HDRS17] score 16, Maudsley Staging Method for treatment-resistant depression score 3, and DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT combined with TAU or to TAU alone. The primary outcome was the alleviation of depressive symptoms, as measured by change in the total GRID-HDRS17 score from baseline to 16 weeks; primary analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 80 patients were randomized; 78 (97.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome, and 73 (91.3%) were followed up for 12 months.

We compared GSP with group HIV education (GHE) for treatment of depression in people with HIV in Uganda. METHODS: In this open-label randomised controlled trial, we included men and women with HIV, aged 19 years or older, who met the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria for major depression from an urban HIV care centre in Kitgum district, northern Uganda. Participants were randomly assigned to receive eight weekly sessions of either GSP or GHE. Randomisation was achieved by urn (men and women separately picked a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket; ratio 1:1), and the intervention sessions were given to gender-specific groups. Participants were followed up immediately after the intervention and 6 months after the end of treatment. The primary outcomes were change in depressive symptom scores (measured with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire) and in function scores (measured with a locally developed method), analysed by intention to treat using cluster-adjusted t tests and permutation tests. This trial is registered with The Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201402000742370. FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, and Jan 20, 2014, we assessed 150 individuals, of whom 109 were randomly assigned to receive eight weekly sessions of either GSP (n=57) or GHE (n=52). Change in mean depression scores immediately after intervention did not differ between groups (mean difference -0.19, 95% CI -1.77 to 1.39, p=0.78). Mean function scores did not differ between groups either (0.24, -0.41 to 0.88; p=0.41). At 6 months after end of treatment, participants in the GSP group had lower mean depression scores than did those in the GHE group (-2.50, -3.98 to 1.02, p value=0.005), and higher function scores (0.74, -0.17 to 1.65, p=0.09) than did participants in the GHE group. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The benefits of existing HIV educational interventions in HIV care services could be improved by the addition of GSP content. Potential benefits of the integration of GSP into existing HIV interventions, such as adherence counselling or group HIV educational programmes, should be addressed in future studies.

Lancet Glob Health. 2020;8(3):e387-e398.";101016;"Background


WHO recommends the use of psychological interventions as first-line treatment for depression in low-income and middle-income countries. However, evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions among people with HIV are scarce. Our aim was to establish the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy (GSP) delivered by lay health workers for depression treatment among people living with HIV in a rural area of Uganda on a large scale.





Methods


In this cluster-randomised trial, we included 30 health centres offering HIV care. These were randomly assigned to deliver either GSP or group HIV education (GHE). Randomisation, in a ratio of 1:1, was achieved by health centre managers separately picking a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket. Participants were people living with HIV, aged 19 years and older, with mild to moderate major depression assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview depression module, taking antiretroviral therapy, and antidepressant-naive. Group sessions were led by trained lay health workers once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants with major depression and function scores at 6 months post-treatment, analysed by intention to treat by means of multilevel random effect regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centres. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201608001738234.





Findings


Between Sept 13 and Dec 15, 2016, we assessed 1473 individuals, of whom 1140 were recruited from health centres offering GSP (n=578 [51%]) or GHE (n=562 [49%]). Two (<1%) participants in the GSP group were diagnosed with major depression 6 months post-treatment compared with 160 (28%) in the GHE group (adjusted odds ratio=0Â·01, 95% CI 0Â·003â€“0Â·012, p<0Â·0001). The mean function scores 6 months post-treatment were 9Â·85 (SD 0Â·76) in the GSP group and 6Â·83 (2Â·85) in the GHE group (Î²=4Â·12; 95% CI 3Â·75â€“4Â·49, p<0Â·0001). 36 individuals had 63 serious adverse events, which included 25 suicide attempts and 22 hospital admissions for medical complications. The outcomes of these serious adverse events included 16 deaths, 4 of which were completed suicides (GSP=2; GHE=2), and 12 of which were HIV-related medical complications (GSP=8; GHE=4). Cost-effectiveness estimates showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$13Â·0 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, which can be considered very cost-effective in Uganda.





Interpretation


Integration of cost-effective psychological treatments such as group support psychotherapy into existing HIV interventions might improve the mental health of people living with HIV.";NA;NA;NA;"Nakimuli-Mpungu, 2020";"Nakimuli-Mpungu_2020_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA_remission(diag)_mini_clinician_0_post"

However, as yet, little research has examined the cognitive effects of these interventions. AIMS: This study investigated the impact of a single session of BA on depressive symptomatology, self-reported avoidance, and behavioural approach and avoidance tendencies. METHOD: Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of Major Depression were recruited from primary care psychological therapies services and block randomized to either a single session of behavioural activation (n = 22) or waiting list control (n = 24) delivered by an unblinded therapist. Self-reports of symptoms and cognitive factors were assessed before and after the one-week intervention phase. Approach and avoidance behavioural tendencies were assessed using the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). RESULTS: Data from 40 participants (n = 20 in each group) was available for analyses. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased, and activation significantly increased from before to after treatment in the treatment group, but not in the control group. Performance on the AAT showed a trend indicating increased approach to positive valence stimuli in the treatment group, but not in the control group. Mediational analyses indicated small indirect effects of self-reported change in activation as mediators of the effect of condition on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a single session of BA can have significant effects on symptoms in clinically depressed patients.

We examined whether Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) was superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing subsyndromal depression among miscarrying women and, secondarily, superior to TAU in improving role functioning. METHOD: Nineteen of 20 eligible women participated in a randomized controlled trial of 1 to 6 weekly telephone sessions of IPC versus TAU, which consisted of whatever lay counseling or professional care women sought on their own initiative, from October 2001 to April 2002. The 2 trial arms were compared on mean within-subject change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17-item (HAM-D-17) scores and in role functioning scale scores (a 5-item modification of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire) from baseline to post-intervention. RESULTS: In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, the baseline mean HAM-D-17 scores were 18.0 (SD +/- 8.4) and 14.8 (SD +/- 6.6) in the IPC (N = 10) and TAU (N = 9) arms, respectively; post-intervention, the corresponding means were 11.6 (SD +/- 8.2) and 12.9 (SD +/- 8.3). The mean within-subject decline in HAM-D-17 scores was significantly greater in the IPC (6.4) than in the TAU (1.9) arm (difference in mean within-subject score decline, adjusted for design features, baseline HAM-D-17 scores and for baseline ethnic imbalance between study arms, 6.2 [95% CI = 0.4 to 12.0]). In a subordinate completers' analysis (N = 15), the corresponding mean decline and difference in adjusted mean decline were 8.0, 2.4, and 6.7 (95% CI = 0.4 to 13.1), respectively.

Andrews, G. (2017). Web-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression in People With Diabetes Mellitus: a Randomized Controlled Trial. Journal of medical Internet research, 19(5), e157.";102196;"BACKGROUND: Depression is twice as common in diabetes mellitus (DM) as the general population and is associated with adverse health outcomes, but access to evidence-based therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is limited in routine diabetes care. Past research has shown that generic Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an effective treatment for depression in the general population, but it has never been evaluated in people with comorbid depression and DM. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the efficacy of a generic 6-lesson iCBT delivered over 10 weeks in people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and DM. METHODS: Participants with comorbid MDD and DM (type 1 or 2) were recruited online and randomized to an iCBT program with therapist support provided by phone and email (n=42) or a treatment as usual (TAU, n=49) control group. Outcomes were assessed through Web-based self-report questionnaires and the trial was Web-based with no face-to-face components. Primary outcomes were self-reported depression (patient health questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), diabetes-related distress (problem areas in diabetes, PAID), and self-reported glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were general distress (Kessler 10-item psychological distress scale, K-10) and disability (short form 12-item, SF-12), generalized anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder 7-item, GAD-7), and somatization (PHQ-15). The iCBT group was assessed at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants (66%; 27/41) completed the iCBT program. Analyses indicated between-group superiority of iCBT over TAU at posttreatment on PHQ-9 (g=0.78), PAID (g=0.80), K-10 (g=1.06), GAD-7 (g=0.72), and SF-12 mental well-being scores (g=0.66), but no significant differences in self-reported HbA1c levels (g=0.14), SF-12 physical well-being, or PHQ-15 scores (g=0.03-0.21). Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up in the iCBT group, and the 87% (27/31) of iCBT participants who were interviewed no longer met criteria for MDD. Clinically significant change following iCBT on PHQ-9 scores was 51% (21/41) versus 18% (9/49) in TAU. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT for depression is an efficacious, accessible treatment option for people with diabetes. Future studies should explore whether tailoring of iCBT programs improves acceptability and adherence, and evaluate the long-term outcomes following iCBT.

Journal of medical Internet research, 19(5), e157.";102196;"BACKGROUND: Depression is twice as common in diabetes mellitus (DM) as the general population and is associated with adverse health outcomes, but access to evidence-based therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is limited in routine diabetes care. Past research has shown that generic Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an effective treatment for depression in the general population, but it has never been evaluated in people with comorbid depression and DM. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the efficacy of a generic 6-lesson iCBT delivered over 10 weeks in people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and DM. METHODS: Participants with comorbid MDD and DM (type 1 or 2) were recruited online and randomized to an iCBT program with therapist support provided by phone and email (n=42) or a treatment as usual (TAU, n=49) control group. Outcomes were assessed through Web-based self-report questionnaires and the trial was Web-based with no face-to-face components. Primary outcomes were self-reported depression (patient health questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), diabetes-related distress (problem areas in diabetes, PAID), and self-reported glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were general distress (Kessler 10-item psychological distress scale, K-10) and disability (short form 12-item, SF-12), generalized anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder 7-item, GAD-7), and somatization (PHQ-15). The iCBT group was assessed at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants (66%; 27/41) completed the iCBT program. Analyses indicated between-group superiority of iCBT over TAU at posttreatment on PHQ-9 (g=0.78), PAID (g=0.80), K-10 (g=1.06), GAD-7 (g=0.72), and SF-12 mental well-being scores (g=0.66), but no significant differences in self-reported HbA1c levels (g=0.14), SF-12 physical well-being, or PHQ-15 scores (g=0.03-0.21). Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up in the iCBT group, and the 87% (27/31) of iCBT participants who were interviewed no longer met criteria for MDD. Clinically significant change following iCBT on PHQ-9 scores was 51% (21/41) versus 18% (9/49) in TAU. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT for depression is an efficacious, accessible treatment option for people with diabetes. Future studies should explore whether tailoring of iCBT programs improves acceptability and adherence, and evaluate the long-term outcomes following iCBT.

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of CBT delivered via telephone for newborn mothers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-based CBT for postnatal depression at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Methods: A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted in the postnatal units at 3 regional hospitals in Hong Kong. A total of 397 women with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score >10 on the second or third day postpartum were randomized to receive telephone-based CBT (n = 197) or standard care (n = 200). Primary outcome was the total EPDS score. A cutoff score of 9/10 on the EPDS was used to define women at risk of postnatal depression. Results: Telephone-based CBT was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms compared with standard care, when assessed at 6 weeks postpartum in the subgroups of mothers with minor depression (EPDS 10-12; difference = 1.90, 95% CI: 0.72-3.08; p = 0.002) and major depression (EPDS >13; difference = 5.00, 95% CI: 3.12-6.88; p < 0.001). The effect was sustained at 6 months postpartum in the subgroup with minor depression (difference = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.09-2.32; p = 0.034) but not significant in the subgroup with major depression (difference = 1.69, 95% CI: -0.10-3.47; p = 0.064). The proportion of women who satisfied our definition of postnatal depression was significantly lower in the intervention group at 6 weeks (difference = 23.3%, 95% CI: 13.7-33.0%; p < 0.001) and 6 months postpartum (difference = 11.4%, 95% CI: 1.9-20.8%; p = 0.019).

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of W-IPT on depressive symptoms and on workplace-related issues in individuals with MDD compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.





Methods: A total of 27 individuals with MDD (mean age = 43 years, 48% males) were randomly assigned either to eight weekly group sessions of W-IPT or to the TAU condition.

Intensive psychotherapy and case management for Karen refugees with major depression in primary care: a pragmatic randomized control trial. BMC Fam Pract. 2020;21(1):17.";101186;"Background


Despite an unparalleled global refugee crisis, there are almost no studies in primary care addressing real-world conditions and longer courses of treatment that are typical when resettled refugees present to their physician with critical psychosocial needs and complex symptoms. We studied the effects of a year of psychotherapy and case management in a primary care setting on common symptoms and functioning for Karen refugees (a newly arrived population in St Paul, Minnesota) with depression.





Methods


A pragmatic parallel-group randomized control trial was conducted at two primary care clinics with large resettled Karen refugee patient populations, with simple random allocation to 1 year of either: (1) intensive psychotherapy and case management (IPCM), or (2) care-as-usual (CAU). Eligibility criteria included Major Depression diagnosis determined by structured diagnostic clinical interview, Karen refugee, ages 18â€“65. IPCM (nâ€‰=â€‰112) received a year of psychotherapy and case management coordinated onsite between the case manager, psychotherapist, and primary care providers; CAU (nâ€‰=â€‰102) received care-as-usual from their primary care clinic, including behavioral health referrals and/or brief onsite interventions. Blinded assessors collected outcomes of mean changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (measured by Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25), PTSD symptoms (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale), pain (internally developed 5-item Pain Scale), and social functioning (internally developed 37-item instrument standardized on refugees) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12â€‰months. After propensity score matching, data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle using repeated measures ANOVA with partial eta-squared estimates of effect size.





Results


Of 214 participants, 193 completed a baseline and follow up assessment (90.2%). IPCM patients showed significant improvements in depression, PTSD, anxiety, and pain symptoms and in social functioning at all time points, with magnitude of improvement increasing over time. CAU patients did not show significant improvements. The largest mean differences observed between groups were in depression (difference, 5.5, 95% CI, 3.9 to 7.1, Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and basic needs/safety (difference, 5.4, 95% CI, 3.8 to 7.0, Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).





Conclusions


Adult Karen refugees with depression benefited from intensive psychotherapy and case management coordinated and delivered under usual conditions in primary care. Intervention effects strengthened at each interval, suggesting robust recovery is possible.";NA;NA;NA;"Northwood, 2020";"Northwood_2020_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA_msd_hscl-d_clinician_0_post"

We report the feasibility and symptom outcomes of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modified (mCBT) to address the needs of perinatal, low-income women with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). METHODS: Pregnant women (n = 1421) were screened for depressive symptoms in obstetrics clinics in conjunction with prenatal care visits. A total of 59 women met diagnostic criteria for MDD; 55 women were randomly assigned to mCBT or Treatment as Usual (TAU). The mCBT intervention included an initial engagement session, outreach, specific perinatal content and interpersonal components. Measures were gathered at pre-treatment, 16 week post-randomization, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Most participants attended at least one CBT session and met study criteria for treatment adherence. Active research staff outreach promoted engagement and retention in the trial. Treatment satisfaction was rated as very good. In both observed and multiple imputation results, women who received mCBT demonstrated greater improvement in depressed mood than those in TAU at 16-week post-randomization and 3-month follow-up, Cohen's d = -0.71 (95% CI -4.93, -5.70). CONCLUSIONS: Modified CBT offers promise as a feasible and acceptable treatment for perinatal women with low-incomes in prenatal care settings.

Exposing university students with blindness to a variety of rational emotive skills that would enable them to manage depression and depressive symptoms could be an important avenue to make them feel less depressed and become more energetic to successfully cope with their academic life. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of group-based rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) intervention on depressive symptoms among selected university students with blindness in Nigeria. To assess the efficacy, a group randomized controlled trial design was employed. Participants (N = 65) recruited from universities in Southeast zone of Nigeria were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 33) and no-intervention control groups (n = 32) after meeting the study inclusionary criteria. REBT Depression Manual was used for the delivery of the intervention while depression was evaluated using Beck Depression Inventory-II. Students in the treatment group took part in the group-based REBT program for a period of 12 weeks and thereafter, a 2-week follow-up meeting, twice per week was done after 2 months of the intervention. All sessions lasted for about 60 min each. Data obtained were analyzed using a 2 3 within between-subjects ANOVA with repeated measures, independent samples t test and paired samples t-test. The study revealed that in comparison to the no-intervention control group, the REBT group had significant reduction in their depression scores both at post-treatment and follow-up evaluations, but no such changes were seen in the control group. Given that an REBT program led to the significant reduction in depression among students with blindness, the implication is that depressive thinking, beliefs, and feelings can be surmounted in this special need population through the application of REBT evidence-based techniques.

Lancet (london, england), 389(10065), 176-185.";101016;"METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants aged 18-65 years scoring more than 14 on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) indicating moderately severe to severe depression from ten primary health centres in Goa, India. Pregnant women or patients who needed urgent medical attention or were unable to communicate clearly were not eligible. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone or EUC combined with HAP in randomly sized blocks (block size four to six [two to four for men]), stratified by primary health centre and sex, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential numbered opaque envelopes. Physicians providing EUC were masked. Primary outcomes were depression symptom severity on the Beck Depression Inventory version II and remission from depression (PHQ-9 score of <10) at 3 months in the intention-to-treat population, assessed by masked field researchers. Secondary outcomes were disability, days unable to work, behavioural activation, suicidal thoughts or attempts, intimate partner violence, and resource use and costs of illness. We assessed serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN95149997.FINDINGS: Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we enrolled and randomly allocated 495 participants (247 [50%] to the EUC plus HAP group [two of whom were subsequently excluded because of protocol violations] and 248 [50%] to the EUC alone group), of whom 466 (95%) completed the 3 month primary outcome assessment (230 [49%] in the EUC plus HAP group and 236 [51%] in the EUC alone group). Participants in the EUC plus HAP group had significantly lower symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory version II in EUC plus HAP group 1999 [SD 1570] vs 2752 [1326] in EUC alone group; adjusted mean difference -757 [95% CI -1027 to -486]; p<00001) and higher remission (147 [64%] of 230 had a PHQ-9 score of <10 in the HAP plus EUC group vs 91 [39%] of 236 in the EUC alone group; adjusted prevalence ratio 161 [134-193]) than did those in the EUC alone group. EUC plus HAP showed better results than did EUC alone for the secondary outcomes of disability (adjusted mean difference -273 [-439 to -106]; p=0001), days out of work (-229 [-384 to -073]; p=0004), intimate partner physical violence in women (053 [029-096]; p=004), behavioural activation (217 [134-300]; p<00001), and suicidal thoughts or attempts (061 [045-083]; p=0001). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $9333 (95% CI 3862-28?169; 2015 international dollars), with an 87% chance of being cost-effective in the study setting. Serious adverse events were infrequent and similar between groups (nine [4%] in the EUC plus HAP group vs ten [4%] in the EUC alone group; p=100).INTERPRETATION: HAP delivered by lay counsellors plus EUC was better than EUC alone was for patients with moderately severe to severe depression in routine primary care in Goa, India. HAP was readily accepted by this previously untreated population and was cost-effective in this setting. HAP could be a key strategy to reduce the treatment gap for depressive disorders, the leading mental health disorder worldwide.FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.BACKGROUND: Although structured psychological treatments are recommended as first-line interventions for depression, only a small fraction of people globally receive these treatments because of poor access in routine primary care. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief psychological treatment (Healthy Activity Program [HAP]) for delivery by lay counsellors to patients with moderately severe to severe depression in primary health-care settings.";"The Healthy Activity Program (HAP), a lay counsellor-delivered brief psychological treatment for severe depression, in primary care in India: a randomised controlled trial";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/650/CN-01297650/frame.html";"Lancet (london, england)";"Patel, 2017";"Patel_2017_bat_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral group intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, decreasing negative thinking, and enhancing self-esteem in young women at risk for depression. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial with 92 college women ages 18 to 24 who were at risk for depression was conducted. METHOD: Participants were randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in a 6-week cognitive-behavioral group intervention. Data on self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and negative thinking were collected via self-report questionnaires from control and experimental groups at baseline, 1 month after the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using mixed-model methodology and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. FINDINGS: Compared to those in the control group, women who received the intervention had a greater decrease in depressive symptoms and negative thinking and a greater increase in self-esteem, and these beneficial effects were maintained over 6-months.

PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of the Study of Women's Emotions and Evaluation of a Psychoeducational (SWEEP), a group therapy for depression treatment based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles that was developed for women with type 2 diabetes was conducted. METHODS: Women with significantly elevated depression symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale >/=16) were randomized to SWEEP (n = 38) or usual care (UC, n = 36). RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that SWEEP was more effective than UC in reducing depression (mean difference of -15 vs. -7, p < .01), decreasing trait anxiety (mean difference of -15 vs. -5, p < .01), and improving anger expression (mean difference of -12 vs. -5, p < .05). Although SWEEP and UC had improvements in fasting glucose (mean difference of -24 vs. -1 mg/dl) and HbA1c (mean difference of -0.4 vs. -0.1 %), there were no statistically significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: SWEEP was more effective than UC for treating depressed women with type 2 diabetes. Addition of group therapy for depression meaningfully expands the armamentarium of evidence-based treatment options for women with diabetes.";"A psychoeducational intervention (SWEEP) for depressed women with diabetes";"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/746/art%253A10.1007%252Fs12160-012-9377-2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12160-012-9377-2&token2=exp=1442233111~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F746%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs12160-012-9377-2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs12160-012-9377-2*~hmac=429ffae242672bd57ef400f1522eb51b6d67f6a51de14452b638bd5ba97c240c";"Ann Behav Med";"Penckofer, 2012";"Penckofer_2012_cbt_cau_NA_NA_msd_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

It compromises treatment adherence and accelerates disease progression. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a group-based counselling intervention for depressed HIV-positive patients in primary health care (PHC) in South Africa using a task shifting approach. METHODS: Using a randomized control design, 76 HIV-positive patients with co-morbid depression were initially recruited. This reduced to 34 in the final cohort. Participants were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was adapted from a local group-based Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) intervention. Process evaluation interviews were held with the HIV counsellors who delivered the intervention and a sub-sample of participants. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed significantly greater improvement on depression scores on the PHQ9 in the intervention group compared to the control group. A significant decline in the mean scores on the HSCL-25 was found for both groups although this was more pronounced for the intervention group. There was no significant improvement in the MSPSS scores. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size of the final cohort affected the power of the study to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the MSPSS. Longer term impact of the intervention is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that group-based counselling for depression in HIV-positive patients can potentially be effectively delivered by appropriately trained and supported lay HIV counsellors. The need for a larger trial is indicated.";"A group-based counselling intervention for depression comorbid with HIV/AIDS using a task shifting approach in South Africa: a randomized controlled pilot study";"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032714000445/1-s2.0-S0165032714000445-main.pdf?_tid=e3cdf052-d234-11e4-8d86-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1427208713_053e7a86bcbebce5cc16b924c2171483 and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032714000445/1-s2.0-S0165032714000445-main.pdf?_tid=0506425c-5ad8-11e5-b3dd-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1442232135_4b009d04d6018e0d9f9d1a136f05c6c9";"J Affect Disord";"Petersen, 2014";"Petersen_2014_ipt_cau_NA_NA_msd_phq-9_self-report_0_post"

Psychoeducation versus treatment as usual in diabetic patients with subthreshold depression: Preliminary results of a randomized controlled trial. Trials. 2009;10:78.";101186;"BACKGROUND: Research on the effects of treating sub-threshold depression in persons with diabetes is scarce in spite of the findings indicating that this condition is highly prevalent in the diabetic population and may increase the risk of developing a subsequent major depression. This study was aimed at exploring the effects of a psycho-educational intervention on depression- and diabetes-related outcomes in patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled study design with a one-year follow-up was used. Fifty patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (74% female, aged 57 +/- 9 yrs, diabetes duration of 10 +/- 8 yrs, BMI 31 +/- 6 kg/m2, HbA1C 7.7% +/- 1.4, 53% insulin treated) were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group underwent four psycho-educational sessions aimed at enabling self-management of depressive symptoms. The control group was informed about the screening results and depression treatment options while continuing diabetes treatment as usual. Both groups were contacted by phone in 2-3-month intervals, and re-assessed for depression after 6 and 12 months. Changes in depressive symptoms and glycaemic control were considered primary outcomes. Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman ANOVA were used to compare between- and within-group indicators at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Both the intervention and the control group reported a significant decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale (Friedman ANOVA chi2 = 10.8 p = .004 and chi2 = 7.3 p = 0.03, respectively). The 6-month and 1-year indicators of glycaemic control as compared to baseline HbA1C values were also improved in both groups (chi2 = 11.6 p = 0.003 and chi2 = 17.1 p = 0.0002, respectively). Between-group differences in depressive symptoms and HbA1C values were not statistically significant either at 6- or at 12-month follow-up (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Psycho-educational treatment appears to be beneficial in diabetic patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, but its effects are comparable with the non-specific support given to the subjects in the control group.

Trials. 2015 Jul 15;16:305.";101186;"BACKGROUND: Elevated depressive symptoms that do not reach criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depression are highly prevalent in persons with diabetes. This study was aimed at determining the efficacy of psychoeducation and physical exercise compared with enhanced treatment as usual on 1-year changes in depressive symptoms, diabetes distress and self-management, and quality of life and metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients with subsyndromal depression. METHODS: Adult type 2 diabetes patients who screened positively for depression and expressed a need for professional help with mood-related issues were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical depression, current psychiatric treatment and advanced diabetes complications. Out of 365 eligible patients 209 consented to either 6 weekly sessions of psychoeducation (A) and physical exercise (B), or to enhanced treatment as usual (C). Computer-generated sequences for block randomisation stratified by gender were used. Depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and diabetes distress, diabetes self-care, metabolic control and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) were analysed at 6-month and 12-month follow-up using repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Out of the 74 patients randomised into group A, 66 into B and 69 into group C, 203 completed the interventions, and 179 patients with all 3 assessments were analysed. Depressive symptoms in participants from the psychoeducational, physical exercise and the enhanced treatment as usual groups improved equally from baseline to 12-month follow-up (time versus time x group effect; F = 12.51, p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.07 and F = 0.609, p = 0.656, eta(2) = 0.007 respectively), as did diabetes distress and quality of life (all p < 0.001), diabetes self-care (p < 0.001 to < 0.05), triglycerides, and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The employed interventions had comparable positive effects on 12-month psychological and diabetes-related outcomes suggesting that even minimal intervention addressing patients' diabetes-related problems and concerns had favourable clinical implications and might be sufficient to treat subsyndromal depression. Further investigation is warranted to clarify possible mechanisms of improvement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN05673017.

This study describes the impact of this course in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Methods: Inclusion criteria were > 50 years, a score of 5 or higher on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and no depressive disorder or psychotropic or psychological treatment. Participants were randomized and stratified by gender: the experimental group (N = 83) was offered the course and the comparison group (N = 88) a movie. There were three measurements: pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6 months after post-treatment. Depressive symptoms constituted the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, satisfaction with life, mastery and reminiscence styles. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing values were replaced by regression imputation. Results: The course reduced depressive symptoms, a decrease that was retained during follow-up. A significant between-group effect size was found (d = 0.58). There was also a reduction in symptoms of anxiety; however, the comparison group showed the same reduction, resulting in a small between-group effect size. Gender and level of depressive symptoms were found to be prognostic factors for the change in depressive symptoms; age was not. Post hoc analyses showed significant between-group effect sizes for females and those with a score above the cut-off of the CES-D. Conclusion: The course ""Looking for Meaning"" can be recommended for people aged over 50 years, females and older adults with a clinically relevant level of depressive symptoms (above cut-off) in particular.

The present study evaluates a community-based MBCT intervention for adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology in a large multi-site, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Method: The participants with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were recruited from the general population and randomized to the MBCT intervention (n = 76) or to a waiting list control group (n = 75). Participants completed measures before and after the intervention. Participants in the experimental condition also completed these measures at a 3-month follow-up. Results: In the experimental condition significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance, and improvements in mindfulness and emotional- and psychological mental health were found, compared to the waiting list (effect sizes Cohen's d = 0.31-0.56). These effects were sustained at the 3-month follow-up. The likelihood of a clinically significant change in depressive symptoms was significantly higher for the MBCT group [odds ratio (OR) 3.026, p<0.01 at post-treatment; NNT = 5.10].

Additionally, the use of new media is becoming increasingly common in psychological interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate a life-review therapy in a face-to-face setting with additional computer use. This study explored whether a six-week life-review therapy with computer supplements from the e-mental health Butler system constitutes an effective approach to treat depression in older adults aged 65 and over. A total of 36 participants with elevated levels of depressive symptoms were randomized to a treatment group or a waiting-list control group and completed the post-assessment. Fourteen individuals in the intervention group completed the follow-up assessment. Analyses revealed significant changes from pre- to post-treatment or follow-up for depression, well-being, self-esteem, and obsessive reminiscence, but not for integrative reminiscence and life satisfaction. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time until the three-month follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group (pre to post: d = 1.13; pre to follow-up: d = 1.27; and group x time effect pre to post: d = 0.72). Furthermore, the therapy led to an increase in well-being and a decrease in obsessive reminiscence among the participants in the intervention group from pre-treatment to follow-up (well-being: d = 0.70; obsessive reminiscence: d = 0.93). Analyses further revealed a significant but small group x time effect regarding self-esteem (d = 0.19).

Therapies that focus on supporting mothers have shown accelerated improvement in maternal well-being but few positive effects for infants (Cooper et al, 2003; Murray et al, 2003). Where interventions focus on addressing mother-infant interaction there appears greater chance of benefit to both mothers and children (Poobabn et al, 2007). A small waiting list controlled trial of a 14-week Mellow Babies group intervention was carried out with 17 mothers and infants under one year. Mellow Babies aims to promote both mother-infant interaction and maternal well-being. Changes in maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and the quality of mother-infant interaction (video observation) were assessed. Maternal mood in mothers attending Mellow Babies improved, with a significant difference in EPDS scores, relative to the control group, at follow-up. Post-intervention, there was a significant difference in levels of positive interactions between groups, favoring mothers attending Mellow Babies. The difference in negative interaction between Mellow Babies and waiting-list control group approached significance, with less negative interaction observed between mothers and infants who attended the group. Participant feedback on the content and process of Mellow Babies was highly positive. The study showed benefits from Mellow Babies for mothers and infants who had exposure to postnatal depression. Further studies with longer-term follow-up and infant outcome measures may substantiate these initial findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

METHODS: Sixty-two breast cancer patients diagnosed with major depression were randomly assigned to GCBT group (N = 31) or a waiting list control group provided with an educational booklet (N = 31). The primary outcome measure was the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-HAMD). The second outcome measures were Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast and Self-Esteem Scale (SES). Assessments were carried out at completion of the study and six-month afterwards. RESULTS: Patients in the GCBT group had a significant reduction in the 17-HAMD mean score by 9 points (p < 0.001), more than any reduction among patients in the control group from baseline to the end of therapy and a significant 7 points (p < 0.001) more reduction from baseline to six-month follow-up. GCBT also yielded significantly greater improvement than the control group with regard to quality of life (QoL; p < 0.01) and self-esteem (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups on improving anxiety (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that GCBT is effective for treating major depression, as well as for improving QoL and self-esteem in breast cancer patients.

We integrated a cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention into the routine work of community-based primary health workers in rural Pakistan and assessed the effect of this intervention on maternal depression and infant outcomes. METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 Union Council clusters in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in equal numbers to intervention or control. Married women (aged 16-45 years) in their third trimester of pregnancy with perinatal depression were eligible to participate. In the intervention group, primary health workers were trained to deliver the psychological intervention, whereas in the control group untrained health workers made an equal number of visits to the depressed mothers. The primary outcomes were infant weight and height at 6 months and 12 months, and secondary outcome was maternal depression. The interviewers were unaware of what group the participants were assigned to. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered as ISRCTN65316374. FINDINGS: The number of clusters per group was 20, with 463 mothers in the intervention group and 440 in the control group. At 6 months, 97 (23%) of 418 and 211 (53%) of 400 mothers in the intervention and control groups, respectively, met the criteria for major depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.36, p<0.0001). These effects were sustained at 12 months (111/412 [27%] vs 226/386 [59%], adjusted OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.36, p<0.0001). The differences in weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores for infants in the two groups were not significant at 6 months (-0.83 vs -0.86, p=0.7 and -2.03 vs -2.16, p=0.3, respectively) or 12 months (-0.64 vs -0.8, p=0.3 and -1.10 vs -1.36, p=0.07, respectively).

Many HIV-infected persons in rural areas live with elevated levels of psychiatric distress, suicidal ideation, and loneliness. This pilot study tested whether brief interpersonal psychotherapy delivered via telephone could reduce psychiatric distress among persons living with HIV-AIDS in rural areas in the United States. METHODS: Seventy-nine participants were assigned randomly to a usual care control condition or to a six-session, telephone-delivered, interpersonal psychotherapy intervention (hereafter referred to as the teletherapy group); participants in the teletherapy group continued to receive standard services available to them in the community. Participants completed self-administered surveys pre- and postintervention that assessed depressive and psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of loneliness, and social support. RESULTS: Participants in the teletherapy group evidenced greater reductions in depressive symptoms and in overall levels of psychiatric distress, compared with those in the control group. Nearly one-third of teletherapy participants reported clinically meaningful reductions in psychiatric distress from pre- to postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone-delivered interpersonal therapy intervention showed potential to reduce depressive and psychiatric symptoms among HIV-infected persons in rural areas.

Methods: A total of 131 individuals were randomized. Assessments took place at baseline (T1), six weeks (T2), and three months (T3). The primary endpoint was change in observer-based depression severity from T1 to T2. Potential negative effects were analyzed in terms of suicidal ideations, symptom deterioration, attitudes toward seeking further help, and other adverse events. Results: iCBT (n = 65) and OPE (n = 66) both reduced depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, with large changes observed for iCBT and medium for OPE (iCBT: Cohen's d = 1.09; OPE: d = 0.60). Differences between groups were significant at the primary endpoint (d = 0.36, p = 0.028). OPE continued to have a positive effect from post-treatment to follow-up, while the effect of iCBT remained stable, with differences between groups not being significant anymore at follow-up. Participants who had undergone prior psychotherapy benefited from both treatments; but for those without prior psychotherapy, iCBT was superior also at follow-up. In the iCBT group 26.2% of the participants reported at least one side-effect. Limitations: The history of psychotherapy was imbalanced between the groups. Some negative effects were assessed in the iCBT group only. Conclusions: Both iCBT and OPE were effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but with iCBT having a more rapid effect. iCBT was specifically superior in those with no prior history of psychotherapy.

Behaviour Research and Therapy. 2015;75:20-31.";101016;"Background: Internet-delivered treatments for depression have proved successful, with supported programs offering the potential for improved adherence and outcomes. Internet interventions are particularly interesting in the context of increasing access to interventions, and delivering interventions population-wide. Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial of an 7-module internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for adults with depressive symptoms (n = 96) compared to a waiting-list control group (n = 92). Participants received weekly support from a trained supporter. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The program was made available nationwide from an established and recognized charity for depression. Results: For the treatment group, post-treatment effect sizes reported were large for the primary outcome measure (d = 0.91). The between-group effects were moderate to large and statistically significant for the primary outcomes (d = 0.50) favoring the treatment group. Gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the efficacy of the internet-delivered Space from Depression treatment. Participants demonstrated reliable and statistically significant changes in symptoms from pre-to post-intervention. The study supports a model for delivering online depression interventions population-wide using trained supporters.

Is immediate adjunctive CBT more beneficial than delayed CBT in treating depression?: A Pilot Study. Journal of Psychiatric Practice. 2015;21(2):107-13.";101097;"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious first-line therapy for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Due to the limited accessibility of CBT, long wait lists result in delayed treatment, which may affect treatment outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial to determine whether delayed CBT reduces the effectiveness of the therapy compared to immediate CBT in patients with MDD receiving pharmacotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive immediate CBT (n=18) or to begin CBT after 6 months (n=20) and received 14 weekly sessions, followed by two additional booster sessions. During the active treatment months, patients in the immediate group demonstrated reductions in scores on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) that were similar to those in the delayed CBT group. However, when the analysis was performed using only data from patients in the delayed group who were still in a depressive episode, there was an overall greater decrease in BDI-II scores in the immediate group vs. the delayed group over the active treatment months, but not specifically at the 6-month endpoint. These findings suggest delays in depression treatment, similar to what occurs with real-world wait list times, may not have a significant impact on the effectiveness of CBT in patients who are already receiving treatment as usual. However, such delays may affect the effectiveness of CBT in those patients who remain depressed during the time delay. A larger trial is necessary to confirm these findings.

New and more effective treatments are required. This is the first randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Body Psychotherapy (BPT) in patients with chronic depression. METHODS: Patients with chronic depressive syndromes (more than 2 years symptomatic) and a total score of >/= 20 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were randomly allocated to either immediate BPT or a waiting group which received BPT 12 weeks later. BPT was manualized, delivered in small groups in 20 sessions over a 10 weeks period, and provided in addition to treatment as usual. In an intention to treat analysis, primary outcome were depressive symptoms at the end of treatment adjusted for baseline symptom levels. Secondary outcomes were self-esteem and subjective quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included and twenty-one received the intervention. At the end of treatment patients in the immediate BPT group had significantly lower depressive symptom scores than the waiting group (mean difference 8.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0-16.7). Secondary outcomes did not show statistically significant differences. When the scores of the waiting group before and after BPT (as offered after the waiting period) were also considered in the analysis, the differences with the initial waiting group remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BPT may be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic depression. Difficulty recruiting and subsequent attrition was one of the limitations, but the findings merit further trials with larger samples and process studies to identify the precise therapeutic mechanisms.";"An exploratory randomized controlled trial of body psychotherapy for patients with chronic depression";"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032713004357/1-s2.0-S0165032713004357-main.pdf?_tid=105c33c6-5ada-11e5-b570-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1442233012_31473ba382f72e5ff475c1e16e23bebb";"J Affect Disord";"Rohricht, 2013";"Rohricht_2013_otherpsy_wl_NA_NA_msd_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

A randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) in HIV-infected individuals. Health Psychology. 2009;28(1):1-10.";101037;"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cognitive-behavioral therapy to enhance medication adherence and reduce depression (CBT-AD) in individuals with HIV. DESIGN: A two arm, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial comparing CBT-AD to enhanced treatment as usual only (ETAU). ETAU, which both groups received, included a single-session intervention for adherence and a letter to the patient's provider documenting her or his continued depression. The intervention group also received 10 to 12 sessions of CBT-AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy as assessed by Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMs) and depression as assessed by blinded structured evaluation. RESULTS: At the acute outcome assessment (3-months), those who received CBT-AD evidenced significantly greater improvements in medication adherence and depression relative to the comparison group. Those who were originally assigned to the comparison group who chose to cross over to CBT-AD showed similar improvements in both depression and adherence outcomes. Treatment gains for those in the intervention group were generally maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments.

DESIGN: A two arm, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial comparing CBT-AD to enhanced treatment as usual only (ETAU). ETAU, which both groups received, included a single-session intervention for adherence and a letter to the patient's provider documenting her or his continued depression. The intervention group also received 10 to 12 sessions of CBT-AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy as assessed by Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMs) and depression as assessed by blinded structured evaluation. RESULTS: At the acute outcome assessment (3-months), those who received CBT-AD evidenced significantly greater improvements in medication adherence and depression relative to the comparison group. Those who were originally assigned to the comparison group who chose to cross over to CBT-AD showed similar improvements in both depression and adherence outcomes. Treatment gains for those in the intervention group were generally maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. By the end of the follow-up period, those originally assigned CBT-AD demonstrated improvements in plasma HIV RNA concentrations, though these differences did not emerge before the cross-over, and hence there were not between-groups differences.

Integrating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression with adherence counselling using the Life-Steps approach (CBT-AD) has an emerging evidence base. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of CBT-AD. Methods In this three-arm randomised controlled trial in HIV-positive adults with depression, we compared CBT-AD with information and supportive psychotherapy plus adherence counselling using the Life-Steps approach (ISP-AD), and with enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) including Life-Steps adherence counselling only. Participants were recruited from three sites in New England, USA (two hospital settings and one community health centre). Patients were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive CBT-AD (one Life-Steps session plus 11 weekly integrated sessions lasting up to 1 h each), ISP-AD (one Life-Steps session plus 11 weekly integrated sessions lasting up to 1 h each), or ETAU (one Life-Steps session and five assessment visits roughly every 2 weeks), randomisation was done with allocation software, in pairs, and stratified by three variables: study site, whether or not participants had been prescribed antidepressant medication, and whether or not participants had a history of injection drug use. The primary outcome was ART adherence at the end of treatment (4 month assessment) assessed via electronic pill caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]) with correction for pocketed doses, analysed by intention to treat. Findings Patients were recruited from Feb 26, 2009, to June 21, 2012. Patients who were assigned to CBT-AD (94 randomly assigned, 83 completed assessment) had greater improvements in adherence (estimated difference 100 percentage point per visit, 95% CI 034 to 166, p=0003) and depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies depression [CESD] score estimated difference 041, 066 to 016, p=0001; Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale [MADRS] score 469, 809 to 128, p=0007; clinical global impression [CGI] score 066, 111 to 021, p=0005) than did patients who had ETAU (49 assigned, 46 completed assessment) after treatment (4 months). No significant differences in adherence were noted between CBT-AD and ISP-AD (97 assigned, 87 completed assessment). No study-related adverse events were reported. Interpretation Integrating evidenced-based treatment for depression with evidenced-based adherence counselling is helpful for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and depression.

METHODS: All adult patients (N = 1515) with MDD symptoms referred to secondary care in 2004-2006 were screened. Eligible, consenting patients were assigned randomly to 10-week IPT (N = 46), PeGT (N = 42), or TAU (N = 46) treatment arms. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy among study participants was evaluated. The Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. Assessment occurred at 1, 5, 3, 6, and 12 months. Actual amount of therapists' labor was also evaluated. All statistical analyses were performed with R software. RESULTS: All three treatment cells showed marked improvement at 12-month follow-up. At 3 months, 42 % in IPT, 61 % in PeGT, and 42 % in TAU showed a mean >/=50 % in HAM-D improvement; after 12 months, these values were 61 %, 76 %, and 68 %. Concomitant medication and limited sample size minimized between-treatment differences. Statistically significant differences emerged only between PeGT and TAU favoring PeGT.

This study assessed the efficacy of CT for depression administered individually in women with metastatic breast cancer and its effect on immune function. METHOD: Forty-five women were randomly assigned to either individual CT or to a waiting-list control (WLC) condition. CT was composed of eight weekly sessions of CT and three booster sessions administered at 3-week intervals following the end of treatment. RESULTS: Patients treated with CT had significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at posttreatment compared to untreated patients. Pooled data from both groups indicated significant reductions of depressive symptoms from pre- to posttreatment, as well as reduction of associated symptoms including anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms.

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, in which primary care patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for a current major depression were assigned to nortriptyline (n = 91) or interpersonal psychotherapy (n = 93) provided within well-structured parameters, or a physician's usual care (n = 92). The main outcome measures were degree and rate of improvement in severity of depressive symptoms and proportion of patients recovered at 8 months. RESULTS: Severity of depressive symptoms was reduced more rapidly and more effectively among patients randomized to pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy than among patients assigned to a physician's usual care. Among treatment completers, approximately 70% of patients participating in the full pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy protocol but only 20% of usual care patients were judged as recovered at 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy effectively treat major depression among primary care patients when provided within specific parameters and for the full acute and continuation phases. Treatment principles recommended by the Depression Guideline Panel of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research are supported.";"Treating major depression in primary care practice.

Internet Interventions, 8, 63-71.";101016;"Background Blended interventions aim to capitalise on the strengths of both computer-based and face-to-face therapy. Studies on this innovative treatment format remain scare. This especially accounts for the group treatment of depression. Method The present study applied eclectic psychotherapy methods to an adult sample exhibiting a variety of depressive symptoms (N = 46). Participants were recruited by a newspaper inlet and randomised either to a treatment or a waiting list condition. Computer supported components were multimedia group sessions, e-learning, online videos and worksheets, remote therapist-patient communication and online pre-post-assessment. Results Large between-group effect sizes on primary outcome depressiveness (CES-D) (F <inf>(1,44)</inf> = 4.88, p = 0.032; d = 0.87) and secondary outcome personal resources (resource scales) (F <inf>(1,44)</inf> = 9.04, p = 0.004; d = 0.73 to F <inf>(1,44)</inf> = 8.82 p = 0.005, d = 1.15) were found in the intention to treat analysis (ANOVA). Subjective evaluation of the intervention revealed high treatment adherence (91%) and high perceived relevance of supportive computer and multimedia components. Participants rated computer and multimedia components comparable to treatment elements such as group interaction or specific cognitive behavioural exercises, and 25% associated the utilisation of those components with treatment success. Depressiveness and age did not predict the utilisation and the appraisal of computer and multimedia components. Discussion Results provide preliminary support for the acceptability and feasibility of the investigated blended treatment in a group with non-specific depressive symptoms. However, small sample size and lack of diagnostics restrict generalizability. Additional research in clinical settings is needed.

Clinical effectiveness of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for depressed older people in primary care: A randomized controlled trial. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2009;66(12):1332-40.";101001;"CONTEXT: In older people, depressive symptoms are common, psychological adjustment to aging is complex, and associated chronic physical illness limits the use of antidepressants. Despite this, older people are rarely offered psychological interventions, and only 3 randomized controlled trials of individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a primary care setting have been published. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of CBT delivered in primary care for older people with depression. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with 4- and 10-month follow-up visits. PATIENTS: A total of 204 people aged 65 years or older (mean [SD] age, 74.1 [7.0] years; 79.4% female; 20.6% male) with a Geriatric Mental State diagnosis of depression were recruited from primary care. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual (TAU), TAU plus a talking control (TC), or TAU plus CBT. The TC and CBT were offered over 4 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores collected at baseline, end of therapy (4 months), and 10 months after the baseline visit. Subsidiary measures were the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Social Functioning Questionnaire, and Euroqol. Intent to treat using Generalized Estimating Equation and Compliance Average Causal Effect analyses were used. RESULTS: Eighty percent of participants were followed up. The mean number of sessions of TC or CBT was just greater than 7. Intent-to-treat analysis found improvements of -3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.73 to -0.42) and -3.65 (95% CI, -6.18 to -1.12) in BDI-II scores in favor of CBT vs TAU and TC, respectively. Compliance Average Causal Effect analysis compared CBT with TC. A significant benefit of CBT of 0.4 points (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.72) on the BDI-II per therapy session was observed. The cognitive therapy scale showed no difference for nonspecific, but significant differences for specific factors in therapy. Ratings for CBT were high (mean [SD], 54.2 [4.1]).

Archives of General Psychiatry. 2009;66(12):1332-40.";101001;"CONTEXT: In older people, depressive symptoms are common, psychological adjustment to aging is complex, and associated chronic physical illness limits the use of antidepressants. Despite this, older people are rarely offered psychological interventions, and only 3 randomized controlled trials of individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a primary care setting have been published. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of CBT delivered in primary care for older people with depression. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with 4- and 10-month follow-up visits. PATIENTS: A total of 204 people aged 65 years or older (mean [SD] age, 74.1 [7.0] years; 79.4% female; 20.6% male) with a Geriatric Mental State diagnosis of depression were recruited from primary care. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual (TAU), TAU plus a talking control (TC), or TAU plus CBT. The TC and CBT were offered over 4 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores collected at baseline, end of therapy (4 months), and 10 months after the baseline visit. Subsidiary measures were the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Social Functioning Questionnaire, and Euroqol. Intent to treat using Generalized Estimating Equation and Compliance Average Causal Effect analyses were used. RESULTS: Eighty percent of participants were followed up. The mean number of sessions of TC or CBT was just greater than 7. Intent-to-treat analysis found improvements of -3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.73 to -0.42) and -3.65 (95% CI, -6.18 to -1.12) in BDI-II scores in favor of CBT vs TAU and TC, respectively. Compliance Average Causal Effect analysis compared CBT with TC. A significant benefit of CBT of 0.4 points (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.72) on the BDI-II per therapy session was observed. The cognitive therapy scale showed no difference for nonspecific, but significant differences for specific factors in therapy. Ratings for CBT were high (mean [SD], 54.2 [4.1]). CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for older people with depressive disorder and appears to be associated with its specific effects.

METHOD: Mothers (N = 70) of children enrolled in Head Start, who reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms, were randomized to either the 8-session, Internet-facilitated intervention (Mom-Net) or delayed intervention/facilitated treatment-as-usual (DI/TAU). Outcomes were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996); the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999), Behavioral Observations of Parent-Child Interactions using the Living in Family Environments coding system (LIFE; Hops, Davis, & Longoria, 1995); the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding Systems (DPICS; Eyberg, Nelson, Duke, & Boggs, 2005); the Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI; Lovejoy, Weis, O'Hare, & Rubin, 1999); and the Parenting Sense of Competence scale (PSOC; Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978). RESULTS: Mom-Net demonstrated high levels of feasibility as indicated by low attrition and high program usage and satisfaction ratings. Participants in the Mom-Net condition demonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression, the primary outcome, at the level of both symptoms and estimates of criteria-based diagnoses over the course of the intervention. They also demonstrated significantly greater improvement on a questionnaire measure of parent satisfaction and efficacy as well as on both questionnaire and observational indices of harsh parenting behavior.

The Lancet Psychiatry, 6(2), 128-139. doi:10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30467-X";101016;"Background: The Thinking Healthy Programme (THP), which is endorsed by WHO, is an evidence-based intervention for perinatal depression. We adapted THP for delivery by volunteer peers (laywomen from the community) to address the human resource needs in bridging the treatment gap, and we aimed to assess its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Methods: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned 40 village clusters (1:1) to provide either THP peer-delivered (THPP) and enhanced usual care (EUC; intervention group) or EUC only (control group) to the participants within clusters. These villages were randomly selected from eligible villages by an independent researcher. The participants were pregnant women aged 18 years or older who had scored at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), who we recruited from households within communities in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The research teams who were responsible for recruiting trial participants were masked to treatment allocations. Participants attended follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months after childbirth. The primary outcomes were the severity of depressive symptoms (assessed by PHQ-9 score) and the prevalence of remission (defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5) in participants with available data 6 months after childbirth, which was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocations. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, adjusting for covariates that were defined a priori or that showed imbalance at baseline. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02111915. Findings: Between April 15 and July 30, 2014, we randomly selected 40 of 46 eligible village clusters for assessment, as per sample size calculations. Between Oct 15, 2014, and Feb 25, 2016, we identified and screened 971 women from 20 village clusters that had been randomly assigned to the THPP and EUC group and 939 women from 20 village clusters that had been randomly assigned to the EUC only group. In the intervention group, 79 women were ineligible for inclusion, 11 women refused screening, 597 women screened negative on the PHQ-9, and one woman did not consent to participate. In the control group, 75 women were ineligible for inclusion, 14 women refused screening, 562 women screened negative on the PHQ-9, and one woman did not consent to participate. We enrolled 283 (29%) women in the intervention group and 287 (31%) women in the control group. At 6 months after childbirth, 227 (80%) women in the THPP and EUC group and 226 (79%) women in the EUC only group were assessed for the primary outcome. The severity of depression (assessed by PHQ-9 scores; standardised mean difference 013, 95% CI 031 to 006; p=007) and prevalence of remission (49% in the intervention group vs 45% in the control group; prevalence ratio 112, 95% CI 095 to 129; p=014) did not significantly differ between the groups 6 months after childbirth. There was no evidence of significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups. Interpretation: THPP had no effect on symptom severity or remission from perinatal depression at 6 months after childbirth, but we found that it was beneficial on some other metrics of severity and disability and that it was cost-effective. THPP could be a step towards use of an unused human resource to address the treatment gap in perinatal depression.

This study examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of short-term counselling in general practice for patients with chronic depression either alone or combined with anxiety. Method. A randomized controlled trial with an economic evaluation was carried out in Derbyshire. One hundred and forty-five patients were recruited at seven GP practices by screening using the Beck Depression Inventory. Both the experimental and control group received routine GP treatment but the experimental group were also referred to the practice counsellor. Depression, anxiety and other mental health symptoms, social and interpersonal functioning and social support were measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Comprehensive costs were also estimated. Results. There was an overall significant improvement in the actual scores over time, but there were no significant differences between the two groups on any of the measures at either 6 or 12 months. However fewer experimental group patients were still 'cases' on the BDI than controls at 12 months. There were no significant differences in the mean total costs, aggregate costs of services, or any service-group costs except for primary care, between the experimental and control groups over time. Conclusions. This trial demonstrates only very limited evidence of improved outcomes in those referred to counselling and increased primary care treatment costs in the short-term. Stricter referral criteria to exclude the more severely depressed in the group (BDI (greater-than or equal to) 24) might have yielded more conclusive results.";"A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychodynamic counselling for general practice patients with chronic depression";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L36221455 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291702006517 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=00332917&id=doi:10.1017%2FS0033291702006517&atitle=A+randomized+controlled+trial+to+evaluate+the+effectiveness+and+cost-effectiveness+of+psychodynamic+counselling+for+general+practice+patients+with+chronic+depression&stitle=Psychol.+Med.&title=Psychological+Medicine&volume=33&issue=2&spage=229&epage=239&aulast=Simpson&aufirst=&auinit=S.&aufull=Simpson+S.&coden=PSMDC&isbn=&pages=229-239&date=2003&auinit1=S&auinitm=";"Psychological Medicine";"Simpson, 2003";"Simpson_2003_dyn_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

Psychotherapy treatments in diabetes mellitus can lead to improvements in both depressive symptoms and glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate whether depressive symptoms can be reduced by psychotherapy treatment delivered as a joint interdisciplinary service to in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression. METHODS: Thirty in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 15) with supportive psychotherapy treatment or a control group (n = 15) that received only standard medical treatment. Patients completed a set of questionnaires at the beginning and end of treatment. These recorded sociodemographic variables, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and diabetes-related problems (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale). RESULTS: Although the diabetic foot syndrome improved significantly in 75% of patients, the extent of depressive symptoms and anxiety reported by the control group did not decrease by the end of treatment. In contrast, in the intervention group, anxiety, depression and diabetes-related problems were all reduced. The extent of anxiety and depression was not, as had been anticipated, associated with the severity of the physical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psychotherapeutic intervention during in-patient treatment can have a positive influence on anxiety, depressive symptoms and diabetes-related problems in patients with diabetic foot syndrome.";"Psychotherapy intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with diabetic foot syndrome";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2007.02370.x/asset/j.1464-5491.2007.02370.x.pdf?v=1&t=iejwnmg2&s=ab2fb28468cd41c15e044c0f64c1e03ddd9db93c";"Diabet Med";"Simson, 2008";"Simson_2008_sup_cau_NA_NA_msd_hads-d_self-report_0_post"

We used a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a self-help programme in reducing depression in people with depression in Chiang Mai Province in Thailand. Fifty-six individuals diagnosed with moderate depression participated. They were assigned randomly to an intervention (n= 27) or control (n= 29) group. The intervention group were given a self-help manual along with standard care and treatment, while the control group continued to receive standard care and treatment. Both groups were also given a short weekly telephone call. The findings showed statistically significant differences between the groups, and within the intervention group, in their depression levels. Between baseline and post-test, a sharp decrease in depression was evident in the intervention group, whereas the level of depression increased in the control group. Between post-test and follow-up, a decrease was apparent in depression in both groups. However, the intervention group showed a much lower level of depression than the control group. The results support the use of bibliotherapy as an adjunct to mental health nurses' and other professionals' work in caring for people with moderate depression in the community.

Although we previously demonstrated the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression in a sample of Hispanic women, this study provides a larger, more diverse sample of African American, Hispanic, and white pregnant women from 3 New York City sites in order to provide greater generalizability. METHOD: A 12-week bilingual, parallel-design, controlled clinical treatment trial compared interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression to a parenting education program control group. An outpatient sample of 142 women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder was randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy or the parenting education program from September 2005 to May 2011. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was the primary outcome measure of mood. Other outcome scales included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). The Maternal Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS) assessed mother's interaction with the fetus. RESULTS: Although this study replicated previous findings that interpersonal psychotherapy is a beneficial treatment for antepartum depression, the parenting education program control condition showed equal benefit as measured by the HDRS-17, EPDS, CGI, and MFAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the recommendation for the use of interpersonal psychotherapy for mild-to-moderate major depressive disorder in pregnancy. The parenting education program may be an alternative treatment that requires further study.

There is a need to develop effective strategies to treat depression and prevent recurrence. Treatments that combine pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches are preferred for treating severe forms of depression. PURPOSE: The study assesses the effect of an integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention in patients with depression. METHODS: This pilot study was a pretest-posttest design study. Thirty adult patients diagnosed with depression attending the psychiatric outpatient department at a district hospital were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or comparison group. Each group had 15 patients. The intervention group received both the intervention and routine hospital treatment and underwent four group integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention therapy sessions. These sessions were held once per week on either Saturday or Sunday, with each session lasting more than 3 hours. Comparison group participants received routine hospital treatment only. Outcome measures, including level of depression, well-being, and work and social adjustment, were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, body-mind-spirit well-being scale, and work and social adjustment scale. Both groups were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. RESULTS: Results showed that both groups had significant reductions in the level of depression, improvements in well-being, and work and social adjustment at 3-month follow-up compared with baseline. In addition, the intervention group showed significant mean differences in levels of depression, well-being, and work and social adjustment compared with the comparison group.

Assessments of depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II) and mindfulness (Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire) were conducted before and after therapy. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis found significant group by time interactions for both depression and mindfulness. Secondary analyses showed depression and mindfulness scores significantly improved for PBCT participants but not for TAU participants, with 64% of PBCT participants showing reliable improvement in depression, compared with 0% of TAU participants.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and cost of a nurse-delivered complex intervention that was designed to treat major depressive disorder in patients who have cancer. METHODS: We did a randomised trial in a regional cancer centre in Scotland, UK. 200 outpatients who had cancer with a prognosis of greater than 6 months and major depressive disorder (identified by screening) were eligible and agreed to take part. Their mean age was 56.6 (SD 11.9) years, and 141 (71%) were women. We randomly assigned 99 of these participants to usual care, and 101 to usual care plus the intervention, with minimisation for sex, age, diagnosis, and extent of disease. The intervention was delivered by a cancer nurse at the centre over an average of seven sessions. The primary outcome was the difference in mean score on the self-reported Symptom Checklist-20 depression scale (range 0 to 4) at 3 months after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as ISRCTN84767225. FINDINGS: Primary outcome data were missing for four patients. For 196 patients for whom we had data at 3 months, the adjusted difference in mean Symptom Checklist-20 depression score, between those who received the intervention and those who did not, was 0.34 (95% CI 0.13-0.55). This treatment effect was sustained at 6 and 12 months. The intervention also improved anxiety and fatigue but not pain or physical functioning. It cost an additional pound sterling 5278 (US$10 556) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. INTERPRETATION: The intervention-Depression Care for People with Cancer-offers a model for the management of major depressive disorder in patients with cancer and other medical disorders who are attending specialist medical services that is feasible, acceptable, and potentially cost effective.";"Management of depression for people with cancer (SMaRT oncology 1): a randomised trial";"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0140673608609915/1-s2.0-S0140673608609915-main.pdf?_tid=2a17347a-5add-11e5-8c74-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1442234344_1f0b4d67bc10b515530321de5a8da89f";"Lancet";"Strong, 2008";"Strong_2008_pst_cau_NA_NA_msd_scl_self-report_0_post"

Therefore, it was considered that a simple intervention conducted in short sessions, focusing on increasing access to positively reinforcing activities, would be efficacious in increasing the availability of rewards. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of such a behavioral activation program that was conducted weekly for 5weeks in 60-min sessions. Late adolescent university students aged 1819years with subthreshold depression were randomly allocated to a treatment (n=62) or a control group (n=56). The primary outcome of the study was the Beck Depression Inventory-II score. Results indicated that late adolescent students in the treatment group showed significant improvements in their depressive symptoms (effect size 0.90, 95% CI 1.28 to 0.51) compared to the control group. Students in the treatment group also showed significant improvements in self-reported rating of quality of life and in behavioral characteristics. It is concluded that this intervention had a large and significant effect despite being short and simple and that this low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy program could be conducted in many different types of institutions.

However, there is a critical need for continued research to develop more effective treatments for the social and psychiatric sequelae of interpersonal trauma and socioeconomic disadvantage.";"A randomized effectiveness trial of interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed women with sexual abuse histories";"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140209/pdf/nihms306045.pdf";"Psychiatr Serv";"Talbot, 2011";"Talbot_2011_ipt_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

General practice patients meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for primary major depressive disorder were randomly allocated either to continue with the treatment they would normally receive (which in the majority of cases included antidepressant medication) or to receive, in addition, sessions of cognitive therapy. At completion of treatment, patients receiving cognitive therapy were significantly less depressed than the comparison group, both on blind ratings of symptom severity made by psychiatric assessors and on a self-report measure of severity of depression. At three-month follow-up cognitive therapy patients no longer differed from patients receiving treatment-as-usual, but this was mainly as a result of continuing improvement in the comparison group.";"Cognitive therapy for major depressive disorder in primary care";"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/144/4/400.full.pdf";"Br J Psychiatry";"Teasdale, 1984";"Teasdale_1984_cbt_cau_NA_NA_remission(cut-off)_bdi-1_self-report_0_post"

Health Technol Assess, 23(47), 1-176. doi:10.3310/hta23470";103310;"BACKGROUND: There is currently insufficient evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies for post-stroke depression. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) compared with usual stroke care for treating post-stroke depression. DESIGN: Parallel-group, feasibility, multicentre, randomised controlled trial with nested qualitative research and a health economic evaluation. SETTING: Acute and community stroke services in three sites in England. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults 3 months to 5 years post stroke who are depressed, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the Visual Analogue Mood Scales 'Sad' item. Exclusions: patients who are blind and/or deaf, have dementia, are unable to communicate in English, do not have mental capacity to consent, are receiving treatment for depression at the time of stroke onset or are currently receiving psychological intervention. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: Participants were randomised (1:1 ratio) to BA or usual stroke care. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated list with random permuted blocks of varying sizes, stratified by site. Participants and therapists were aware of the allocation, but outcome assessors were blind. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention arm received up to 15 sessions of BA over 4 months. BA aims to improve mood by increasing people's level of enjoyable or valued activities. The control arm received usual care only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary feasibility outcomes concerned feasibility of recruitment to the main trial, acceptability of research procedures and measures, appropriateness of baseline and outcome measures, retention of participants and potential value of conducting the definitive trial. Secondary feasibility outcomes concerned the delivery of the intervention. The primary clinical outcome 6 months post randomisation was the PHQ-9. Secondary clinical outcomes were Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire - Hospital version, Nottingham Leisure Questionnaire, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living, Carer Strain Index, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version and health-care resource use questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were recruited in 27 centre-months of recruitment, at a recruitment rate of 1.8 participants per centre per month. The 25 participants randomised to receive BA attended a mean of 8.5 therapy sessions [standard deviation (SD) 4.4 therapy sessions]; 23 participants were allocated to usual care. Outcome assessments were completed by 39 (81%) participants (BA, n=18; usual care, n=21). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 6-month follow-up were 10.1 points (SD 6.9 points) and 14.4 points (SD 5.1 points) in the BA and control groups, respectively, a difference of -3.8 (95% confidence interval -6.9 to -0.6) after adjusting for baseline PHQ-9 score and centre, representing a reduction in depression in the BA arm. Therapy was delivered as intended. BA was acceptable to participants, carers and therapists. Value-of-information analysis indicates that the benefits of conducting a definitive trial would be likely to outweigh the costs. It is estimated that a sample size of between 580 and 623 participants would be needed for a definitive trial. LIMITATIONS: Target recruitment was not achieved, although we identified methods to improve recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: The Behavioural Activation Therapy for Depression after Stroke trial was feasible with regard to the majority of outcomes. The outstanding issue is whether or not a sufficient number of participants could be recruited within a reasonable time frame for a definitive trial. Future work is required to identify whether or not there are sufficient sites that are able to deliver the services required for a definitive trial.

QUESTION: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? METHOD: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with major depressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health QUESTIONnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9).

Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. CONCLUSIONS: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for depression.

Behavior Therapy. 2015;46(2):193-205.";101016;"Depression is a common and significant health problem among older adults. Unfortunately, while effective psychological treatments exist, few older adults access treatment. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the efficacy, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of a therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) intervention for Australian adults over 60 years of age with symptoms of depression. Participants were randomly allocated to either a treatment group (n=29) or a delayed-treatment waitlist control group (n=25). Twenty-seven treatment group participants started the iCBT treatment and 70% completed the treatment within the 8-week course, with 85% of participants providing data at posttreatment. Treatment comprised an online 5-lesson iCBT course with brief weekly contact with a clinical psychologist, delivered over 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), a measure of symptoms and severity of depression. Significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 (Cohen's d=2.08; 95% CI: 1.38 - 2.72) and on a measure of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item) (Cohen's d=1.22; 95% CI: 0.61 - 1.79) were observed in the treatment group compared to the control group at posttreatment. The treatment group maintained these lower scores at the 3-month and 12-month follow-up time points and the iCBT treatment was rated as acceptable by participants. The treatment group had slightly higher Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) than the control group at posttreatment (estimate: 0.012; 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.020) and, while being a higher cost (estimate $52.9l 95% CI: -23.8 to 128.2), the intervention was cost-effective according to commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds in Australia. The results support the potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided iCBT as a treatment for older adults with symptoms of depression.

Yet, there are few interventions that target depressive symptoms and HIV risk for people who use drugs (PWUD). This study was a randomized controlled trial of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and HIV prevention intervention to reduce depressive symptoms, injection risk behaviors and increase condom use in a sample of urban people who used heroin or cocaine in the prior 6 months. A total of 315 individuals aged 18-55, who self-reported at least one HIV drug and sex risk behavior and scored >/=16 and <40 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale were randomized using a two-block design, stratified by sex to ensure equivalent numbers, to a 10 session intervention arm (n = 162) or a single session control arm (n = 153). The outcomes of interest were decreases in CES-D score and injection risk behaviors and increases in condom use. The sample was majority African American (85%) and unemployed (94%). Nearly half (47%) reported injection in the prior 6 months and only 19% were taking medication for depression. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months. Retention at 12 months was 94%. Intervention arm was associated with statistically significantly lower CES-D score at 12 month compared to control. No differences were observed between arms in injection risk. At 6 month, intervention was associated with greater odds of condom use with non-main partner. These findings suggest the potential role of the integrated intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, but weak impact on HIV risk.

Method This superiority trial used a single blind randomised parallel group design to test the efficacy of time-limited Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) for treatment resistant depression (TRD). Patients referred to secondary care community mental health teams (CMHT) who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode, had received antidepressant treatment >6 weeks, and had Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores of >16 were recruited. The effects of 20 sessions of ISTDP were judged through comparison against secondary care CMHT treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was HAM-D scores at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) self-report measures for depression and dichotomous measures of both remission (defined as HAM-D score <7) and partial remission (defined as HAM-D score <12). Results Sixty patients were randomised to 2 groups (ISTDP=30 and TAU=30), with data collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Multi-level linear regression modelling showed that change over time on both depression scales was significantly greater in the ISTDP group in comparison to TAU. Statistically significant between-group treatment differences, in the moderate to large range, favouring ISTDP, were observed on both the observer rated (Cohen's d=0.75) and self-report measures (Cohen's d=0.85) of depression. Relative to TAU, patients in the ISTDP group were significantly more likely after 6 months to achieve complete remission (36.0% vs. 3.7%) and partial remission (48.0% vs. 18.5%). Limitations It is unclear if the results are generalizable to other providers, geographical locations and cultures.

METHOD: Fifty-seven community dwelling cardiac patients scoring >13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) received a single-session brief intervention. They were then block randomised to either six sessions of group CBT (n = 25) or no further intervention (BI; n = 32). All were re-assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months. Differences between treatment groups in the primary (BDI-II) and secondary [rates of depression; anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A)] outcomes were examined using generalised linear mixed models with a random intercept term for the individual. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen for the total group from baseline to 12 months on BDI-II and HADS-A scores. However, no differences were found between the CBT and BI conditions on change in BDI-II score, rates of major depressive episode or HADS-A score. Post hoc analysis on the total group found 12-month symptom non-remission was associated with higher baseline BDI-II score (p = 0.03), more visits to health professionals 12 months prior to baseline (p = 0.05) and a greater likelihood of either drinking alcohol over recommended levels or smoking at baseline (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Group CBT of up to six sessions did not result in greater reductions in depression or anxiety symptoms compared with a single-session brief intervention. Further work should focus on the efficacy and role of brief interventions, and addressing smoking and alcohol misuse in cardiac patients with depression.";"Randomised controlled trial of group cognitive behaviour therapy versus brief intervention for depression in cardiac patients";"http://anp.sagepub.com/content/47/3/235.full.pdf";"Aust N Z J Psychiatry";"Turner, 2013";"Turner_2013_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P < 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P < 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P < 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.";"Web-based depression treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized, controlled trial";"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3024341/pdf/320.pdf";"Diabetes Care";"van Bastelaar, 2011";"vanBastelaar_2011_cbt_wl_NA_NA_otherdich(sign.change)_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

The studies of indicated prevention of depression aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a problem-solving intervention in preventing clinical depression in a sample of female caregivers. METHOD: A controlled randomized trial was conducted among 173 participants (mean age 53.9 years), 89 of whom were randomized to the intervention group and 84 (controls) to usual care. The intervention comprised five weekly 90-minute group sessions. RESULTS: At post-treatment, depression symptoms in the intervention group had remitted significantly more than in the control group, with a large effect size ( d = 1.54). The proportion of participants showing clinically significant improvement was significantly larger in the intervention group (80.9% vs. 11.9% among controls), and fewer intervention-group participants had progressed to clinical depression during the study period (4.5% vs. 13.1% among controls). The intervention group also exhibited a significantly greater reduction in emotional distress and caregiver burden than the control group.

The secondary aim was to conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the behavioral activation component alone compared to the complete cognitive-behavioral intervention. Method: Sixty-one caregivers (mean age 58.4 years) were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral intervention via conference call (CBC, n = 20), a behavioral activation intervention via conference call (BAC, n = 22) or a control group receiving usual care (CG, n = 19). Both interventions consisted of five 90-minute group sessions implemented weekly. Results: Only 6.6% of caregivers discontinued the study. In the CBC and BAC groups, attendance and satisfaction with the intervention were similarly high among both groups. Homework adherence was also high in both groups. At post-treatment, there was a lower incidence of depression in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (0.0% for BAC and CBC vs. 10.5% for CG). The relative risk was 0.0, and number needed to treat was 10 in both groups. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (d = 2.18 and d = 2.06).

METHODS: Eighty-seven women who sought treatment from a public health service in Curico, Chile, and who had severe depression and a history of childhood traumatic experiences were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention (N=44) or standard treatment (N=43). The participants were assessed at baseline and at three months (completion of the intervention) and six months with use of the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D); Lambert's Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), which rates psychiatric symptoms, interpersonal relationships, and social role functioning; and the Post-traumatic Stress Treatment Outcome scale (PTO 8), which assesses symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. An intent-to-treat design was used with multiple analyses of variance. RESULTS: At three months significant differences were found in favor of the intervention group in Ham-D scores (p<.001) and OQ-45.2 scores (p<.05). At six months a significantly greater proportion of the intervention group had indicators of remission as measured by the OQ-45.2 (39% versus 14%, p<.05) and by the Ham-D (22% versus 5%, p<.05). Scores on the PTO 8 indicated significant improvements in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at six months, although there were no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: An outpatient intervention that screened for and focused on childhood traumas and that helped patients understand current psychosocial difficulties as a repetition of past traumas was effective in reducing psychiatric symptoms and improving interpersonal relationships and social role functioning among women with severe depression and a history of childhood trauma.";"Evaluation of an outpatient intervention for women with severe depression and a history of childhood trauma";NA;"Psychiatr Serv";"Vitriol, 2009";"Vitriol_2009_dyn_cau_NA_NA_msd_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

The Internet may offer interesting alternatives for reaching and helping people with depression. Depression can be treated effectively with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but a short intervention based on problem solving therapy (PST) could constitute a worthwhile alternative to CBT. OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT and Internet-based PST in comparison to a waiting list control group (WL), and we determined the differences between the two treatments. METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to compare CBT, PST, and WL. The main inclusion criterion was presence of depressive symptoms (>or= 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale). CBT and PST consisted of eight and five weekly lessons respectively. Participants were supported by email. Self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at pretest and after 5, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 263 participants were randomized to the three conditions (CBT: n=88; PST: n=88; WL: n=87). Of the 263 participants, 184 (70%) completed questionnaires after 5 weeks, 173 (66%) after 8 weeks, and 151 (57%) after 12 weeks. Between-group effect sizes for depressive symptoms were 0.54 for CBT after 8 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 - 0.84) and 0.47 for PST after 5 weeks (95% CI: 0.17 - 0.77). These effects were further improved at 12 weeks (CBT: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.98; PST: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.36 - 0.95). For anxiety, effect sizes were also at a medium level. Effect sizes for quality of life were low. The number of participants showing clinically significant change at 12 weeks was significantly higher for CBT (n = 34, 38.6%) and PST (n = 30, 34.1%), compared to WL (n = 0).

Method: A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP), a psychotherapy model developed specifically to treat chronic depression (n = 67) with care as usual (CAU; evidence-based treatments, n = 72) over a period of 52 weeks, with 23 sessions on average, in 3 outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. In both arms algorithm-based pharmacotherapy was provided. Patients (aged 18-65) met criteria for a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder with diagnostic specifiers (chronic, without interepisode recovery) or with co-occurring dysthymic disorder indicating a chronic course. The Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) Self-Report was used as the primary outcome measure. Mixed-effects linear regression analysis was used to compare the changes on the IDS scores between CBASP and CAU. The IDS was administered before treatment, and after 8, 16, 32 and 52 weeks. Results: At week 52, patients assigned to CBASP had a greater reduction of depressive symptoms compared to patients assigned to CAU (t =-2.00, p = 0.05). However, CBASP and CAU did not differ from each other on the IDS after 8 weeks (t = 0.49, p = 0.63), 16 weeks (t =-0.03, p = 0.98) and 32 weeks (t =-0.17, p = 0.86) of treatment. Conclusions: This trial shows that CBASP is at least as effective as standard evidence-based treatments for chronic depression. In the long run, CBASP appears to have an added effect. 2014 S.

JAMA. 2000;284(12):1519-26.";NA;"CONTEXT: Insufficient evidence exists for recommendation of specific effective treatments for older primary care patients with minor depression or dysthymia. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in primary care settings among older persons with minor depression or dysthymia. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial (November 1995-August 1998). SETTING: Four geographically and clinically diverse primary care practices. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 415 primary care patients (mean age, 71 years) with minor depression (n = 204) or dysthymia (n = 211) and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score of at least 10 were randomized; 311 (74.9%) completed all study visits. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine (n = 137) or placebo (n = 140), starting at 10 mg/d and titrated to a maximum of 40 mg/d, or problem-solving treatment-primary care (PST-PC; n = 138). For the paroxetine and placebo groups, the 6 visits over 11 weeks included general support and symptom and adverse effects monitoring; for the PST-PC group, visits were for psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depressive symptoms, by the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20) and the HDRS; and functional status, by the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) physical and mental components. RESULTS: Paroxetine patients showed greater (difference in mean [SE] 11-week change in HSCL-D-20 scores, 0.21 [0. 07]; P =.004) symptom resolution than placebo patients. Patients treated with PST-PC did not show more improvement than placebo (difference in mean [SE] change in HSCL-D-20 scores, 0.11 [0.13]; P =.13), but their symptoms improved more rapidly than those of placebo patients during the latter treatment weeks (P =.01). For dysthymia, paroxetine improved mental health functioning vs placebo among patients whose baseline functioning was high (difference in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 5.8 [2.02]; P =. 01) or intermediate (difference in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 4.4 [1.74]; P =.03). Mental health functioning in dysthymia patients was not significantly improved by PST-PC compared with placebo (P>/=.12 for low-, intermediate-, and high-functioning groups). For minor depression, both paroxetine and PST-PC improved mental health functioning in patients in the lowest tertile of baseline functioning (difference vs placebo in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 4.7 [2.03] for those taking paroxetine; 4.7 [1.96] for the PST-PC treatment; P =.02 vs placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Paroxetine showed moderate benefit for depressive symptoms and mental health function in elderly patients with dysthymia and more severely impaired elderly patients with minor depression. The benefits of PST-PC were smaller, had slower onset, and were more subject to site differences than those of paroxetine.";"Treatment of dysthymia and minor depression in primary care: A randomized controlled trial in older adults";"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/681/CN-00299681/frame.html and http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4753/JOC00569.pdf";"Jama";"Williams, 2000";"Williams_2000_pst_otherctr_NA_NA_remission(cut-off)_hdrs_clinician_0_post"

PLoS One. 2013;8(1):e52735.";NA;"Background: Access to Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression is limited. One solution is CBT self-help books. Trial Objectives: To assess the impact of a guided self-help CBT book (GSH-CBT) on mood, compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Hypotheses: 1. GSH-CBT will have improved mood and knowledge of the causes and treatment of depression compared to the control receiving TAU 2. Guided self-help will be acceptable to patients and staff. Methods and Findings: Participants: Adults attending seven general practices in Glasgow, UK with a BDI-II score of (greater-than or equal to)14. 141 randomised to GSH-CBT and 140 to TAU. Interventions: RCT comparing 'Overcoming Depression: A Five Areas Approach' book plus 3-4 short face to face support appointments totalling up to 2 hours of guided support, compared with general practitioner TAU. Primary outcome: The BDI (II) score at 4 months. Numbers analysed: 281 at baseline, 203 at 4 months (primary outcome), 117 at 12 months. Outcome: Mean BDI-II scores were lower in the GSH-CBT group at 4 months by 5.3 points (2.6 to 7.9, p<0.001). At 4 and 12 months there were also significantly higher proportions of participants achieving a 50% reduction in BDI-II in the GSH-CBT arm. The mean support was 2 sessions with 42.7 minutes for session 1, 41.4 minutes for session 2 and 40.2 minutes of support for session 3. Adverse effects/Harms: Significantly less deterioration in mood in GSH-CBT (2.0% compared to 9.8% in the TAU group for BDI-II category change). Limitations: Weaknesses: Our follow-up rate of 72.2% at 4 months is better than predicted but is poorer at 12 months (41.6%). In the GSH-CBT arm, around 50% of people attended 2 or fewer sessions. 22% failed to take up treatment. Conclusions: GSH-CBT is substantially more effective than TAU.

Aims To assess the effectiveness of an 8-week community-based CBT self-help group classes on symptoms of depression, anxiety and social function at 6 months (trial registration: ISRCTN86292664). Method In total, 142 participants were randomly allocated to immediate (n = 71) or delayed access to a low-intensity CBT intervention (n = 71). Measures of depression, anxiety and social function were collected at baseline and 6 months. Results There was a significant improvement for the primary outcome of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (mean betweengroup difference: -3.64, 95% CI -6.06 to -1.23; P = 0.004). The percentage of participants reducing their PHQ-9 score between baseline and 6 months by 50% ormore was 17.9% for the delayed access group and 43.8% for the immediate access group. Secondary outcomes also improved including anxiety and social function. The intervention was cost neutral. The probabilities of a net benefit at willingness to pay thresholds of 20 000, 25 000 or 30 000 were 0.928, 0.944 and 0.955, respectively. Conclusions Low-intensity class-based CBT delivered within a community setting is effective for reducing depression, anxiety and impaired social function at little additional cost.

Aims To assess the effectiveness of an 8-week community-based CBT self-help group classes on symptoms of depression, anxiety and social function at 6 months (trial registration: ISRCTN86292664). Method In total, 142 participants were randomly allocated to immediate (n = 71) or delayed access to a low-intensity CBT intervention (n = 71). Measures of depression, anxiety and social function were collected at baseline and 6 months. Results There was a significant improvement for the primary outcome of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (mean betweengroup difference: -3.64, 95% CI -6.06 to -1.23; P = 0.004). The percentage of participants reducing their PHQ-9 score between baseline and 6 months by 50% ormore was 17.9% for the delayed access group and 43.8% for the immediate access group. Secondary outcomes also improved including anxiety and social function. The intervention was cost neutral. The probabilities of a net benefit at willingness to pay thresholds of 20 000, 25 000 or 30 000 were 0.928, 0.944 and 0.955, respectively. Conclusions Low-intensity class-based CBT delivered within a community setting is effective for reducing depression, anxiety and impaired social function at little additional cost.

Annals of family medicine 2018; 16(2): 111â€<90>9.";101370;"PURPOSE: We undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of groupbased behavioral activation with mindfulness (BAM) for treating subthreshold depression in primary care in Hong Kong. METHODS: We recruited adult patients aged 18 years or older with subthreshold depression from public primary care clinics and randomly assigned them to a BAM intervention group or a usual care group. The BAM group was provided with eight 2hour weekly BAM sessions by trained allied health care workers. Patients in the usual care group received usual medical care with no additional psychological interventions. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression InventoryII at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included incidence of major depressive disorder at 12 months. We assessed quality of life, activity and circumstances change, functional impairment, and anxiety at baseline, end of intervention, 5 months, and 12 months. RESULTS: We randomly allocated 115 patients to the BAM intervention and 116 patients to usual care. At 12 months, compared with usual care peers, BAM patients had a slightly more favorable change in levels of depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression InventoryII (betweengroup mean difference in score = 3.85; 95% CI, 6.36 to 1.34; Cohen d = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.16). Incidence of major depressive disorder was lower with BAM (10.8% vs 26.8%, P = .01), whereas groups did not differ significantly on other secondary outcomes at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Group BAM appears to be efficacious for decreasing depressive symptoms and reducing the incidence of major depression among patients with subthreshold depression in primary care, although generalizability of our findings may be limited.";"Treating Subthreshold Depression in Primary Care: a Randomized Controlled Trial of Behavioral Activation With Mindfulness";"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01627218/full and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5847348/pdf/0160111.pdf";"Annals of family medicine";"Wong, 2018";"Wong_2018_3rd_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

METHOD: Medication-free participants (N=45) with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive therapy (N=15), computer-assisted cognitive therapy (N=15), or a wait list (N=15). Both active treatments consisted of nine sessions over 8 weeks. Therapist time was reduced after the first visit for computer-assisted cognitive therapy, with 25-minute sessions rather than 50-minute sessions. Assessments were completed pretreatment, after 4 and 8 weeks of therapy, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy were superior to the wait list control group for treatment of depression and did not differ from each other on the primary outcome variables. Very large between-group effect sizes were observed. Improvement in depression for both computer-assisted cognitive therapy and standard cognitive therapy was maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations. Computer-assisted cognitive therapy had more robust effects, relative to being wait-listed, than standard cognitive therapy in reducing measures of cognitive distortion and in improving knowledge about cognitive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A multimedia, computer-assisted form of cognitive therapy with reduced therapist contact was as efficacious as standard cognitive therapy.

METHOD: Medication-free participants (N=45) with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to cognitive therapy (N=15), computer-assisted cognitive therapy (N=15), or a wait list (N=15). Both active treatments consisted of nine sessions over 8 weeks. Therapist time was reduced after the first visit for computer-assisted cognitive therapy, with 25-minute sessions rather than 50-minute sessions.

Accordingly, the primary objective of the current study was to test the effects of a group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program in treating co-morbid anxiety and depression in a sample of older age adults. METHOD: A total of 133 community-dwelling participants aged 60 years (mean age = 67.35, s.d. = 5.44, male = 59) with both an anxiety disorder and unipolar mood disorder, as assessed on the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS), were randomly allocated to an 11-week CBT group or discussion group. Participants with Mini-Mental State Examination scores <26 were excluded. Participants were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 6 months follow-up on the ADIS, a brief measure of well-being, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory and Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: Both conditions resulted in significant improvements over time on all diagnostic, symptom and wellbeing measures. Significant group x time interaction effects emerged at post-treatment only for diagnostic severity of the primary disorder, mean severity of all anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and all disorders, and recovery rates on primary disorder.

METHOD: This is a randomized study registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-17011289). Eighty rural left-behind elderly people who had a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score between 11 and 25 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention group received both MBAT and regular treatment for 8 weeks while the control group received regular treatment. Both groups were assessed with the GDS, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months post-intervention. RESULTS: There were a total of 73 participants that completed the intervention. The scores of GDS and BAI decreased significantly, but the scores of OHQ increased significantly in the intervention group after 8 sessions of MBAT (P<.01). The reduction in depression symptoms after the intervention was maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Significant differences in GDS, BAI, and OHQ scores were observed between the intervention group and the control group (P<.01). CONCLUSION: MBAT produced a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than regular care in rural left-behind elderly. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: A modified behavioral activation (BA) psychotherapy can significantly reduce the recurrence and seriousness of depression symptoms in the left-behind elderly with mild to moderate depression.

The current study attempted to design and test a comprehensive selfcontrol training (CSCT) program with an overall emphasis on behaviral activation in depressed Chinese college students. METHODS: Participants included 74 students who had diagnosed with major depression, they were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: intervention group (n=37), and control group (n=37). The intervention participants received an eightweek CSCT and fourmonth followup consolidation program, as compared to the control group who received only prepostandfollowup measurements. All participants measured Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Selfcontrol Scale (SCS) at three time points: baseline, posttraining, and fourmonth followup. RESULTS: The dropout rates were 6 (8.1%) in the intervention group and 3 (4.1%) in the control group at the end of sixmonth intervention. The general linear model repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that comparing with the control group, the intervention group participants had more increase in their trait selfcontrol score, at the meantime, their depressive symptoms had significantly improved. Univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that participants with milder baseline depressive symptoms were more likely to benefit from CSCT interventions; depression improvement was also associated with the number of sessions attended. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation was related to the small sample size which consisted of college students who were relatively young and well educated. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that CSCT program could temporarily enhance selfcontrol capacity as well as improve depressive symptoms; participants who are mildly to moderately depressed, and who could adhere to the training protocol are more likely to benefit from the intervention.";"Comprehensive self-control training benefits depressed college students: a six-month randomized controlled intervention trial";"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01421524/full";"Journal of affective disorders";"Yang, 2018";"Yang_2018_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA_msd_bdi-2_self-report_0_post"

Methods: Seventy-five Chinese patients with depression in outpatient clinics were randomized into a 5-week intervention. The intervention group received the Chinese translated version of MoodGYM in addition to usual treatment, and the control group continued with usual treatment. Participants completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre- and post-intervention. Results: We conducted multivariate linear regression analyses to compare the change in CES-D scores for completers after the intervention. Seventy-eight percent (n = 29) of participants in the intervention group and 84% (n = 32) of patients in the control group completed the post-treatment assessments, and no serious adverse events were reported. Results indicated that while both groups significantly improved at post test, the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group (t(59) = 2.37, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Computerized CBT can be a cost-effective adjunct to medication treatment, particularly in areas with limited access to mental health services. The use of online computerized CBT has been found to be effective in many studies in Western countries, but has not been studied among Chinese outpatients. This study suggests that online computerized CBT is acceptable, and that MoodGYM is a feasible and efficacious augmentative treatment, specifically when used within an outpatient clinic population. With this small sample size we were able to demonstrate that the addition of MoodGYM to usual care improved treatment outcomes for outpatients with depression in China.";"Outcomes of an online computerized cognitive behavioral treatment program for treating chinese patients with depression: A pilot study";"http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619354556 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2017.11.007 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=18762026&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ajp.2017.11.007&atitle=Outcomes+of+an+online+computerized+cognitive+behavioral+treatment+program+for+treating+chinese+patients+with+depression%3A+A+pilot+study&stitle=Asian+J.+Psychiatry&title=Asian+Journal+of+Psychiatry&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Yeung&aufirst=Albert&auinit=A.&aufull=Yeung+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=";"Asian Journal of Psychiatry";"Yeung, 2017";"Yeung_2017_cbt_wl_NA_NA_change_ces-d_self-report_0_post"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of CBT, antidepressants alone (MED), combined CBT and antidepressants (COMB) and standard treatment (ST; i.e., receiving psycho-educational intervention and/or medication treatment determined by treating psychiatrists) on depressive symptoms and social functioning in Chinese patients with moderatesevere MDD. Method: A total of 180 patients diagnosed with MDD according to ICD-10 were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment regimens for a period of 6 months. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (C-QIDS-SR). Remission threshold was defined as a C-QIDS-SR total score of <5. Social functioning was evaluated with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). All outcome measures were evaluated at entry, and at 3- and 6-months follow-up. Results: At the 6-months assessment, the remission rates in the whole sample (n = 96), the MED, the CBT, the COMB and the ST groups were 54.2%, 48%, 75%, 53.5% and 50%, respectively. Following the treatment periods, there was no significant difference in any of the study outcomes between the four groups. However, the CBT showed the greatest effect in the HAMD total score with the effect size = 0.94, whereas the ST has only a moderate effect size in the WSAS total score (effect size = 0.47). Conclusions: The findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of CBT as a psychosocial intervention for Chinese patients with moderatesevere MDD. We also found that single treatment using MED or CBT performed equally well as the combined CBT-antidepressant treatment in controlling the remission.
